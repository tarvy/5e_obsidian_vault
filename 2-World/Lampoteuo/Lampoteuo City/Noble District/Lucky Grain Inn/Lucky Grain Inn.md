### Inn Keeper Name
Lorelei Ravenswood - A mysterious and enigmatic woman with long, dark hair and piercing green eyes. She always wears a flowing black gown that seems to blend seamlessly with the shadows. Lorelei is known for her sly smile and her ability to keep secrets. 

> [!info]- Inn Description
> The inn is a cozy, rustic establishment with a welcoming ambiance. As you walk in through the heavy wooden door, you'll find yourself on the bottom floor, which exudes warmth and character. The far wall is dominated by a sturdy wooden bar, polished to a shine and lined with an assortment of glassware and bottles. 
> 
> In the center of the room, five round tables are evenly spaced out, each accompanied by comfortable wooden chairs where patrons gather to enjoy their food and drink. The tables are well-worn but clean, suggesting years of hearty meals and lively conversations.
> 
> To your right, a staircase clings to the wall, leading up to the second floor. It's made of dark wood and creaks slightly underfoot, adding to the inn's old-world charm.
> 
> On the left wall, there's a cozy section covered by a rich carpet with intricate patterns. A few stools are scattered around this area, making it a perfect spot for guests who prefer a more relaxed seating arrangement. 
> 
> Just ahead on this same wall is a grand fireplace, its mantel adorned with trinkets and framed pictures. The fire crackles warmly within, casting a homely glow across the room and providing much-needed heat during colder months.
> 
> At the back left corner of the room, double doors lead out to an inviting outdoor sitting area where patrons can enjoy fresh air and perhaps take in views of the surrounding landscape.
> 
> On the right side of the room toward the back are doors that lead to both the kitchen and washrooms. The kitchen door swings open frequently as servers bustle in and out with trays laden with delicious smelling dishes. The washrooms are discreetly tucked away but clearly marked for convenience.
> 
> The entire space is illuminated by soft lighting from wrought-iron chandeliers overhead and lanterns mounted on wooden beams along the walls. The atmosphere is one of comfort and camaraderie—a place where travelers can rest easy after their journeys or locals can gather for good company and conversation.
