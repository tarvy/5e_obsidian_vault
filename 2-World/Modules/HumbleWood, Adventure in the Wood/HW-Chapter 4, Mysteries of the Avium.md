Now that the [aspect of fire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/aspect-of-fire-hwcs.md) has awoken from its long slumber, it's only a matter of time before it fully replenishes. Once it does, the aspect will surely have enough power to reduce all of Humblewood to ashes.

The seal which kept the aspect of fire sleeping beneath the Grove was broken by a corvum mage named [Odwald Ebonhart](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/odwald-ebonhart-hwcs.md). Odwald deeply regrets his actions and blames himself for the spreading wildfires. In his desperation, he has returned to the Avium, where he was once a student, and disguised himself as a librarian in order to access its resources. Out of fear for what might befall the Wood if the aspect is not stopped, Odwald has begun to secretly research the darkest of necromancies. He created a monstrous undead creature known as a [cobblefright](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/cobblefright-hwcs.md), which he hopes will provide him with the key to stopping the elemental menace once and for all. In so doing, Odwald has placed the Avium in grave danger, for his control of the monster is imperfect. Strange occurrences on campus have aroused the suspicions of a few students and professors that something isn't quite right at the Avium. While the Dean, [Gabe Windsworth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gabe-windsworth-hwcs.md), doesn't yet have any concrete information, he's hoping the party will be able to investigate and help him uncover the mystery. This will lead the way to Odwald and his dangerous scheme.

## After the Escape

Be sure to allow the party some downtime after the events of Part 3: An Urgent Summons to prepare for the journey to the Avium. The aspect of fire poses a great danger to the Wood, but there's still a good amount of time to deal with the situation. If players feel pressed, have a messenger approach them with a missive from the Council, stating that the aspect hasn't moved from Scorched Grove, according to information obtained from the Alderheart observatory. Scholars cannot make any concrete predictions, but many theorize that the creature may need to remain near an area that is closely tied to elemental fire magic.

### Traveling to the Avium

The Avium lies to the east of Alderheart. From special observation platforms in the city, the gigantic floating structures of the mage college can be seen rising above the trees of the forest. The College isn't terribly far, but the roadway curves around the eastern forest in order to avoid the dangers which lurk there. This part of Humblewood is known to be a nesting ground for [forest prowlers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/forest-prowler-hwcs.md), deadly predatory cats that grow leaves and vines on their fur to better blend with their surroundings.

Taking the road poses less risk, but it will cost the party three days of travel to reach the Avium. The path through the forest is much more dangerous and harder to navigate, but if the party moves quickly they can cut down their time, making it to the Avium in about two days.

### The Long Road

If the party takes the long road around the forest, there are a few ways to handle this. The first and easiest way is to skip to them arriving at the Avium after an uneventful journey. This is useful for speeding up the pace of the game, or if players are itching to get to the next story beat. Be sure to mention things they encountered along the way to provide additional context:

- If the Bandit Coalition was crushed, Humblewood will have an increased presence of Perch Guard forces. The party might see merchant caravans carrying supplies from Brackenmill being escorted by Perch Guard lancers known as "The Spears." Perhaps some of the Perch Guard will even be hauling Bandit Coalition prisoners who managed to escape the fortress back to Alderheart for trial and sentencing.  
- If the Bandit Coalition has started to transition into the Wildwood Brigade, the party might see intrepid groups of ex-bandits turned rangers. These individuals may be helping escort supply trains and refugees to prepared camps where food, shelter, and medical supplies are available. It seems like everyone is doing their part to keep the Wood together in these trying times.  

### Random Encounters

If the party enjoys travel time and random adventures on the road, use the [Forest Encounters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/appendix-e-random-encounters-forest-encounters-level-1-2-hwcs.md) table to decide what they encounter. For each day of travel, roll a `d20`, and on a roll of 5 or lower, roll on the encounter table to see what happens. Some of these fights might be easy for a party of level 4 adventurers, so more enemies can be added to provide a greater challenge.

### Optional Encounter: My Name is Krall

Not every bandit shares Benna's idealism. A few bad seeds will either use her death as an opportunity to promote themselves, or they'll balk at the idea of a reformed Coalition and splinter off into disparate groups. Use this optional encounter to add danger to the route, and help illustrate the new threats that have risen in the wake of the Coalition's destruction or transformation.

These new bandits are no better than raiders, and they prey on humblefolk and birdfolk alike. Among the strongest are forces led by a mapach known as [Krall, the Scavenger King](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/krall-the-scavenger-king-hwcs.md). After hearing news of the party traveling through his territory, Krall is interested in cementing his reputation among the remaining raider factions by taking down the adventurers who either killed or turned Benna.

Krall has a force of bandits lying in ambush in the surrounding forest. These include a [jerbeen thief](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-thief-hwcs.md), two [mapach bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md), and his vulpin lieutenant: [Shyla Denn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/shyla-denn-hwcs.md).

As the party approaches Krall's trap, the forest seems eerily quiet. Something is amiss. The bandits are well-hidden in the dark undergrowth, so rather than using passive perception, have each character make a DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to spot the ambush. If anyone fails this check, they will spend their first round surprised. Read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You see a burly mapach with matted fur, missing in patches, sitting on the road ahead, casually picking his teeth with a long, pointed dagger. He wears studded leather armor and has a rapier sheathed at his hip. He eyes you maliciously as you approach, standing to reveal that he is nearly six feet tall. "Well well, if it isn't Alderheart's lackeys."
^0cd

Krall immediately attacks with his force. The thief supports him in melee combat while his priest and the two mapach bandits stay in the forest and attack the party at range. Krall will order Shyla to heal him if he is wounded, but otherwise she is free to attack using her own judgement, and support the bandits with her spells as needed.

The dense forest provides a half cover bonus to anyone within it, and creatures there can hide as an action on their turn.

During the fight on his turn, Krall will boast:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "If you thought Benna was tough, then you lot got no idea what you're in for. I'll show the whole Wood how harmless you really are."
^0ce

This is a challenging fight, and if it looks like the party is having trouble add some wandering Perch Guard NPCs to aid them. A force of three birdfolk skirmishers should turn the tide in the party's favor, but the guards will be focused on defending the party and won't pursue Krall into the forest if he makes a run for it. Perch Guard forces should also come to chase off Krall if he's victorious, though he won't stick around for too long.

If Krall wins, he'll settle for humiliating the heroes by stealing something of value from each party member. Retrieving these items could be the basis of a whole side adventure all its own.

Krall seeks revenge, but he isn't so foolhardy as to risk death here. If the party seems amenable, he'll beg for mercy and turn himself in. He has connections in Alderheart's criminal underbelly, and he would rather be imprisoned than dead. If the party doesn't seem like the merciful sort, Krall will order his forces to scatter into the forest when things look grim. Once he enters the forest, the party has only 2 rounds to capture him before he leads his pursuers into a prepared escape burrow where he will pull a lever which snaps a wooden portcullis over the entrance. The portcullis can be broken by spending an action and succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check, but in this time Krall will already have traveled down one of the many branching pathways of the tunnel and made a clean getaway. His followers don't know about the escape burrow, and they can be easily captured. Krall won't hesitate to cut them loose to save himself.

If any Perch Guard came to offer assistance, those remaining will sound a horn, calling on reinforcements that will arrive in the next few minutes. This will include combat medics who can help tend to the party's wounds. The Perch Guard have orders to take a share of any treasure recovered from either Krall or his bandits back to Alderheart. However, the Guard appreciates the party's service to the Wood and will look the other way if the party decides to take the treasure for themselves.

> [!note] Treasure
> 
> The bandits all have standard equipment for their stat blocks, with the exception of Krall's parrying dagger, which appears to be of high quality and is branded with the insignia of the Bandit Coalition on its pommel. Treat this weapon as a [shortsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shortsword.md). It also allows anyone proficient with shortswords to use their reaction to parry one melee attack that targets them, adding +2 to their AC against it. They must be wielding the weapon in order to use this feature.
> 
> - Each of the mapach bandits have pouches filled with 35 gp and the jerbeen thief has an opal (worth 200 gp) in their pouch.  
> - The priest has a flawless emerald (worth 350 gp) and three spell scrolls: [spiritual weapon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/spiritual-weapon.md), [spirit guardians](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/spirit-guardians.md), and [locate object](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/locate-object.md).  
> - Krall himself has a [chime of opening](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/chime-of-opening.md) with five remaining uses in his bag, along with a pair of exquisite rubies (worth 600 gp each) and a small sapphire (worth 200 gp).

## The Ancient Forest

The forest may be a quicker route to the Avium, but progress is slow in the dense undergrowth. This part of the forest is ancient, and its floor is a thick carpet of ferns, moss, and other plant life. Treat all areas in this forest that are not clearings or groves as difficult terrain, unless the party does something about it. Spells that deal fire or acid damage can remove the difficult terrain from target areas. Characters can also choose to climb up the branches and travel via gliding if they are birdfolk, completely bypassing the difficult terrain. The forest is thick enough that anyone up at least 30 feet in the giant trees will have an easy time finding branches in gliding range, allowing them to make progress at normal speed, or scout ahead with ease if they so desire.

Gigantic 60-foot-tall trees form a canopy that significantly weakens incoming sunlight, and only dim light filters down from above. It's easy to hide here, and cover is readily available behind the trunks of the giant trees. Even with a map, there are no recognizable landmarks, and it doesn't take much for travelers to become disoriented. At least one character must lead the group, succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check every four hours of travel to avoid getting lost. Getting lost means the party must spend another hour wandering off-course before they can correct their course. Each time the party fails one of these checks, roll on the Ancient Forest Encounters table to see what they encounter in their wanderings.

**Ancient Forest Encounters**

`dice: [](5-part-4-mysteries-of-the-avium.md#^ancient-forest-encounters)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A thicket containing a hidden [shambling mound](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/shambling-mound.md), which attacks as soon as a character enters its reach. It can be seen with a passive perception of 14 or higher. |
| 2 | A group of `1d4` [giant elk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-elk.md) can be seen grazing peacefully by a grove with a clear pond. |
| 3 | The bones of a [giant elk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-elk.md), picked clean and growing moss. A successful DC 17 Intelligence ([Nature](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check is enough to tell this was done by a [forest prowler](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/forest-prowler-hwcs.md). |
| 4 | A 60-foot-wide clearing contains `1d3` [giant boars](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-boar.md) rooting around the soil for food. They have `1d4` young (Medium sized beasts that cannot attack) with them and will attack if provoked. |
| 5 | An [owlbear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear.md) can be seen in a clearing nearby. It is young (only has half its normal hit points) and hasn't yet spotted the party. There is another owlbear, its mother, also nearby. The mother will arrive after a round of combat has passed to defend her child. |
| 6 | A [unicorn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/unicorn.md) appears in a small grove. It is wary, but can be approached if the party is careful. If befriended, it will heal the party's wounds. If threatened, it will flee. |
^ancient-forest-encounters

### Hunter and Prey

The party will eventually encounter the [forest prowler](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/forest-prowler-hwcs.md) that has been nesting in the area for the last month. It makes its home in the treetops in well-camouflaged nests made from leaves and branches. A sure way to tell a prowler's nest from a giant bird's is the stench of meat. Prowlers keep carrion from the animals they hunt, usually giant elk or boars, on nearby branches as a source of food.

This encounter should happen towards the end of the party's journey through the forest. The characters could come across the prowler's lair mere hours from the forest's end, or the beast could ambush them as they camp for the night. As long as the party keeps moving in a stealthy manner, they will elude the beast, but if they stay camped in one spot for more than an hour the forest prowler will be alerted to their presence.

However the encounter happens, the prowler will study the party from a distance first, biding its time as they move through its territory. It will attempt to use its stealth to approach the party quietly, and will single out the smallest and most vulnerable character among the group as its prey. The prowler hunts through hit-and-run tactics, disappearing into the foliage with its camouflaging fur before pouncing again on unsuspecting foes. The prowler's incredible claws give it a solid grip on tree trunks, and it can climb even the highest branches with ease. Once it begins its assault it won't stop until it has scored a kill, or has been critically wounded.

## The Avium

After the party has either made their way through the forest or reached the end of the road, they will arrive at the Avium, the magical college of the birdfolk. Here arcane spellcasters from all over Humblewood study, decipher mystic secrets, and teach the next generation their craft.

> [!note] Odwald's Disguise
> 
> Throughout most of this part, Odwald Ebonhart has assumed the identity of the librarian Mordane Swiftgale. To avoid confusion, the person the players know as Mordane will be referred to in this text as Odwald. This ensures that it is clear when reading this part that certain events do not involve the real Mordane. Be cautious when GMing, and refer to the disguised Odwald only as Mordane until Odwald's true identity has been revealed.
^odwalds-disguise

### Important Information

At the heart of the Avium is a mystery the players will need to solve. The party's suspicions should be aroused when they start their research and realize much of the information they require is missing. In most cases, books have had pages torn out. The tomes were vandalized by Odwald while in a frantic state, before he took [Mordane Swiftgale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mordane-swiftgale-hwcs.md) hostage and assumed his appearance.

As Librarian Swiftgale, Odwald now has access to all of the highly regulated books in a part of the College known as the lower library (see Into the Library). He can manipulate the records to account for missing books and place suspicion on others.

During his research, Odwald has uncovered a frightening truth: the aspect of fire is immortal, its energies have seeped into the Scorched Grove over centuries, creating a well of power it can use to reconstruct its form if it is ever destroyed. However, evidence of his earlier panicked search still remains, and Odwald worries that the heroes may use it to expose him.

The torn-out pages contain information necessary for the party to defeat the aspect of fire, but the players won't be able to find this out until they discover Odwald's secret chamber in the library, where he has been using the information he stole to plan a way to kill the aspect. Odwald has been dabbling in dangerous necromancy, and he's created a [cobblefright](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/cobblefright-hwcs.md) to aid in his research, seeking to study its soul siphon ability in order to recreate the effect as a large-scale spell. If it works, such a spell might drain the vital energies that make the aspect immortal, ending its threat to the Wood once and for all. The cobblefright is a threat to all who currently live and study in the Avium, and the party will need to uncover Odwald's secret laboratory and dangerous monster before he loses control of his creation.

There are many pathways players can follow throughout this investigation, and many ways for the party to come across important information. The party doesn't need to know everything to find out the location of Odwald's lair, but the more they know, the more complete their picture of the happenings at the Avium will be. Because there are many connections players can make between different leads, clues, and avenues of investigation, some sections will cross-reference others that might be relevant.

If the players are lost or unsure where to go, an NPC can deliver one or more of the following hints to move the narrative along:

- Only faculty members have access to tomes dealing with high-level or forbidden magic, and even then it's solely intended for research purposes. Removing one of these dangerous books from the lower library, or practicing the knowledge they contain, is grounds for termination from the Avium.  
- One tenured librarian, Mordane Swiftgale, has always been an odd one, but lately he's been keeping to himself even more than usual.  
- Secret rooms were built into the Avium, and many remain undiscovered to this day.  
- A lot of odd things seem to be happening in and around the lower library. Books with missing pages, malfunctioning servitor skeletons, and strange noises coming from the stacks, have all been reported.  

Players can find the information they need through reading tomes in the library or speaking with knowledgeable NPCs on campus. By the end of their time at the Avium players should know the following:

- The aspect of fire is immortal. There is no known way to destroy it without it simply regenerating.  
- The aspect of fire consumes living forests for energy.  
- The aspect of fire is weakened by cold damage, which may cause it to cool and become immobilized.  
- In the past, the aspect of fire was sealed away using a conjuration circle somewhere in the Grove.  

### Arriving on Campus

The Avium is a remarkable structure, and as the party approaches it, either from the forest or from the road, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Four gigantic circular stone platforms float alongside several towers and spires in the air above you. These structures slowly rotate around a leafless and branchless tree trunk made from solid stone. The trunk towers hundreds of feet high, and the orbiting structures appear to connect to stone bridges which jut out of the trunk near its upper levels. You see two Perch Guards in crenellated watch posts above the entryway to this petrified trunk. They greet you, and moments later a robed, bespectacled raptor glides down to land at your feet.
^0d6

The raptor is an associate professor named [Rhys Birchwalker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rhys-birchwalker-hwcs.md), who has been sent to greet the party. She explains the Dean is expecting them, and then leads the party to the large central gate, which appears to be the only entrance into the structure. She withdraws a an amulet with the Avium's crest upon it from the folds of her robe and presents it to the giant wooden double doors. After a brief moment the same symbol etches itself in light across the entrance. Then, with a heavy creak, the doors begin to part, revealing an interior lounge.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A main desk sits near the far wall, behind which a scribe is busy with tottering piles of paper. Several chairs and couches are situated around circular tables throughout the room, which is lit comfortably by floating braisers containing magical flames. Portraits of wizened birdfolk hang from the walls, each one wearing robes similar to those of your attendant.
^0d7

Behind the main desk is a spiral staircase that leads down. The staircase is flanked by a pair of large birdfolk statues, one of which bears the likeness of a corvum whose portrait hangs from the west wall. Opposite this staircase, a circular platform rests in its own cylindrical alcove.

Professor Birchwalker leads the party onto the circular platform and utters an incantation, which causes the entire stone disk to rise from the ground and propel the group upwards through the tree trunk. A few windows occasionally zip by on the way up, showing glimpses of the Wood and just how high the party is traveling. The platform stops halfway up the structure, and the party finds themselves in an area next to a busy atrium. Following Professor Birchwalker, everyone arrives at the Dean's office.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You and your companions enter into a round stone office. It is surrounded on all sides by windows, through which several spires and large circular terrariums can be observed slowly floating by. The many tables inside the office are filled with disorganized piles of books, and the desk is in a similar state of disorder. A sable luma peeks up from over the books. "Oh, please excuse me! I'm reviewing a few... hundred theses for my students. Excellent work! But, one does tend to lose track of time. I'm terribly sorry."
^0d8

The luma is [Gabe Windsworth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gabe-windsworth-hwcs.md), the Dean of the Avium. He will apologize profusely and clear a few tomes off his desk before moving to give each party member a firm handshake and an official welcome to his College. The Dean will then cut right to the chase: he knows why the party is here and what they've come for, thanks to messages from the Council. He is eager to help them find whatever they need to stop the aspect of fire. The Dean will tell the party:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "You won't find information on something that old and powerful in just any library. Thankfully, the Avium was built upon the greatest store of knowledge in all of Humblewood... literally! Beneath the main building is the oldest structure here, a library with a collection of tomes, folios, and manuscripts gathered from all over Everden. With any luck, that's where you'll find what you're looking for. Now, a disclaimer—some of the tomes in there are a little... uh, deadly. But worry not, our librarians are experts. They'll help point you in the right direction while steering you clear of the more... 'advanced' materials."
^0d9

He will then give each of the characters a small amulet with the insignia of the Avium. These appear to be of lesser quality than Professor Birchwalker's, and Dean Windsworth will inform the party that these are amulets, made especially for guest researchers. The party will then be free to roam the grounds.

The Dean knows the importance of their mission, but he also knows they've had a long journey. The amulets will give the party access to dormitory chambers that have been prepared specifically for them. The room will have exactly the right number of bunkbeds for the playgroup. The party won't need to worry about food either, as their guest amulets grant them free meals at the campus dining hall. Characters are also free to sit in on any lectures they wish to attend around campus, as well as to peruse the more conventional libraries housed in the orbiting structures.

![[z_Assets/73cfc3e7a9ddcdcc88ec3569361df66a_MD5.webp]]

## Exploring The Avium

Refer to Fig. 4.1 for a map of the Avium.

![[z_Assets/02fb955c1d84115f12d4b2b6ebcf978b_MD5.webp]]

At the heart of the Avium is the central building, made from the trunk of a petrified tree. It is orbited by four terrariums and a dozen or so smaller towers. Each structure which orbits the trunk does so at varying heights and speeds, between one rotation every 10 minutes, and one rotation every half hour.

The orbiting structures each have gliding platforms and moveable bridges, which correspond with bridge sections on other structures and connect at regular intervals to form complete overpasses. These structures stay aligned for 10 minutes, allowing for crossing by foot. For humblefolk students, knowing when to cross can make the difference between missing a class and arriving on time. But for birdfolk, the entire aerial campus can be traversed with ease. If ever in doubt about how long it will take for the route to an orbiting structure to connect, roll `3d10` and use that number in minutes to decide when the next favorable rotation will be.

There are many places in the Avium for characters to explore, and characters can spend their time here however they wish. Those who so desire can learn new spells or concoct potions. To track the party's activities, let the players know that each day they spend in the Avium consists of eight hours within which they can benefit from all the College has to offer. After this time, several campus areas close their doors to students, and only those with special faculty amulets can get past security. Studying at the College can grant one of the following benefits:

- Wizards who study here can add any spell on the wizard's spell list to their spellbook, but they still require the necessary amount of coin and time to do this. Spells are only granted to wizards deemed worthy of their power, meaning only spells of a level the wizard could cast will be made available.  
- By spending a full day studying and practicing, any bard, ranger, sorcerer or warlock can swap one spell they have learned previously for another of the same level that is on their class spell list.  
- Additionally, any character proficient with a [herbalism kit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/herbalism-kit.md) can avail themselves of the campus potions laboratory, which stocks reagents needed for potion making. Creating a potion can be done for the normal cost (to help cover the expenses associated with growing so many magical herbs) and only takes one day of brewing instead of the normal amount of time it would take to craft such an item.  

### 1. Central Building

Faculty offices, most lecture halls, the large communal dining hall, and the infirmary are all located in the central building. A Perch Guard station near the middle of the central building serves as the headquarters for campus security forces. Servitor skeletons can often be found here, performing janitorial tasks.

### 2. The Terrariums

The four terrariums are circular stone structures with bowl-shaped bottoms and mostly flat surfaces. They are contained in magical spherical fields, which allow matter to pass through, but are designed to shield and contain magical blasts. This keeps the surrounding structures safe in case of an accident. Three of the terrariums are 200 feet in diameter. They contain different biomes and are used for natural research. The fourth is smaller, only 100 feet across, and is located higher up. It houses a security building, as well as a gaol, both overseen by the Perch Guard.

### 3. The Towers

The floating towers are between 40 to 80 feet across, and they are the oldest structures orbiting the central tree. Some house libraries and small classrooms on niche subjects, mostly for advanced students of a particular school of magic. Other towers contain laboratories for practicing spellcraft, testing established arcane theorems, and brewing potions.

### 4. The Dean's Office

Located high in the Avium's structure, this large office belongs to Dean Windsworth. More than just his private study, it is a historical part of the building, having been used by every headmaster of the Avium since the College's founding. Dean Windsworth can often be found here poring over documents.

### 5. Dormitories

The central building houses dormitories for students and faculty. The student rooms are near the lower part of the tree, and are divided by an individual's standing within the Avium, with those in their first year having rooms closer to the ground. The faculty dorms rest above these, in areas off limits to students.

### 6. Lower Library

The lower library consists of a series of rooms and corridors, shaped from inside the tree's stone roots. Unlike many of the classrooms in the central building, which have been remodeled, much of the lower library remains unchanged since the days of the Avium's founding. It contains the most dangerous and rare books in the Avium, and only high ranking faculty members and a few special guest researchers are privy to the contents within. The sturdy stone shelves here are molded from the same stone that makes up the floor. They tower with books and require little in the way of care beyond dusting (though some sections are clearly overdue for it).

## Into the Library

The staircase near the entrance leads down to the lower library. This area is only accessible to those with the appropriate pass, at appropriate times of day. If the party attempts to descend the stairs without their guest amulets or outside of normal hours, the two [stone golems](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/stone-golem.md) that guard the entrance (the birdfolk statues on either side of the stairway) will come to life and attempt to stop them. The golems seek only to restrain the party until Perch Guard authorities arrive. If the party attempts combat, the golems will defend themselves, but they will strike with calculated force. Any character reduced to 0 hit points by the golems will remain stable, since the sentries are under strict commands to incapacitate intruders, not kill them.

As characters enter the lower library they will be greeted by the librarian, Mordane Swiftgale, who is actually Odwald Ebonhart in disguise. This is a magical effect produced by a specially crafted pendant that Odwald wears, and as long as he (or anyone else) wears it, they will look and sound exactly like Mordane Swiftgale. This is a transmutation effect, although it has been supplemented with illusion spells so as not to appear magical when examined with [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) or similar effects.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you reach the bottom of the long and winding staircase, you emerge into a room filled with rows upon rows of large stone shelves, each containing several hundred books. Magical braisers illuminate this area, but their light strains to reach every nook between the large bookshelves. A swift strig sits reading behind a desk in the center of the room. As you approach he puts down his book and eyes you curiously. "The Defenders of Alderheart, I presume?"
^0e2

Odwald will inform the party that he is Mordane Swiftgale, and he's been instructed to help them find whatever they need. While the request came directly from the Dean, Odwald has some trepidation about assisting the party. He fears that if the heroes start poking around, they'll discover the pages he tore from the tomes. If characters notice his nervousness and make a Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check, have Odwald make an opposed Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check. Even if a character succeeds they won't find out anything incriminating, only that Mordane appears apprehensive. If characters report the missing pages to him, Odwald will feign shock and confusion and recommend they notify the Dean as such vandalism is taken very seriously. If a character doesn't believe Odwald, have the character make another Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check opposed by Odwald's Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check.

A success will show the character that Mordane is clearly flustered, but nothing more. Odwald's bluster is in character with Mordane, who was always passionate about the library, and this will help to conceal his true identity.

For players who want to use their downtime to research the aspect, they need to decide what types of information to look for. The information the characters will be looking for can broadly fit into four categories: **The Scorched Grove**, **The Great Calamity**, **Elemental Creatures**, and **Conjuration Magic**. Each category has an associated amount of time required for research in order to obtain all the information for that category. This time can be lessened by having multiple characters research different areas of the same topic.

> If the party ends up stuck during research, or are unsure of what to do, you can always have them run into one of the NPCs in this chapter: Professor Birchwalker, Professor Revayne, or even Dean Windsworth. Any of these characters would be able to guide the party in their research and help point them towards the sections they should investigate.

> Alternatively, if your party finds the research portion boring, you can skip to the incident in Shadows Fall early. This will provide some action and a quick transition from the party's investigation into the strange occurrences happening at the Avium. 
^helping-the-party

While Odwald wants to stop the party's efforts, he knows just how much attention he could draw to himself if he acts out of character. He'll guide them to the first three topics, but anyone looking for help acquiring information on Conjuration Magic will find Mordane busying himself with other tasks, such as cataloging source materials and returning tomes to far-flung wings of the enormous underground library.

If what a player wants to research doesn't fit into one of these categories, either base the findings on what's known about the aspect (be careful not to give too much away), or rule that while they located the tome they were looking for, all important information appears to have been on pages that were ripped out. No matter how much time the characters spend on research, the information on torn-out pages can't be found in other books.

### The Scorched Grove

There are many books here regarding the Scorched Grove, and since scholarly interest in this subject is so focused on its physical properties, origins, and fauna, it won't take more than a day of research before a character finds information repeating itself or covering the same questions from increasingly esoteric angles.

Most of the writing available on the Grove covers what was already provided in Part 3: An Urgent Summons. Reiterate information for the players if necessary, or just say that no new information is available. However, one book found by a character researching this topic will contain important knowledge. The character finds the following passage:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> ... from the above evidence, one can conclude that the Scorched Grove displays properties which suggest extreme conjury, perhaps even the calling of a major elemental force. Whether this was conjured from a nearby plane or a farther one remains uncertain, but the readiness with which the elemental magics have taken root suggests a source in close proximity to our world.
^0e5

### The Great Calamity

There is very little work of substance on the Great Calamity, as numerous books addressing the subject resort to legend more than truth. Those books which do attempt serious historical study of the event note the relative lack of credible living witnesses. In terms of overall scope, there is a wealth of material written about the Calamity, although the information is unfocused and spread across many books. It could take a character three days of research to get through all there is to read. Quite a few books have had pages torn out and these seem to reference prophecies of some kind, but it's unclear exactly what they pertain to.

The following passage was found:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> ... regardless of the origin of the Calamity, whether or not the rumors of an elder elemental being hold any truth to them, a magical event of incredible significance is almost certain to have taken place. The calling of such elemental energies, whether through evocation or conjuration, would require a mage of unparalleled skill, or an entity of unfathomable power.
^0e7

Details on the aspect have been torn out of one book: an eyewitness account, from someone who claimed to have seen a "creature of fire and destruction."

Read this when the torn out pages are found (see The Old Classroom):

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "It flared so brightly as it consumed the forest. It turned the burning trees into fuel, gaining power as it devoured them, and left naught but ashes in its wake."
^0e8

### Elemental Creatures

A fairly straightforward avenue of research, the library holds a wealth of tomes on elemental creatures. However, elementals of the size seen in the Grove comprise a narrow field of study, and a character researching this subject should be able to find everything they need to know in about two days of study. The following information can be found:

- The most important thing they will learn is that elementals of this size are normally elder elementals, incredibly powerful beings that re-shape the lands in which they live through their sheer presence. These beings would require advanced conjuration magics to summon.  
- Many elder elementals have the traits of one or two elements working in concert. Stories from across Humblewood tell of a fire and earth elemental who may have been involved in the calamity that birthed the Scorched Grove.  
- They'll find this passage in an old book:  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Elemental creatures composed of fire that also possess earth elemental traits tend to be incredibly strong and durable, and do not appear to retain their vulnerability to cold-typed magics. However, cold-typed magic should theoretically be able to...
^0ea

- The following page is torn out. Read this when the torn out pages are found (see The Old Classroom):  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> ...slow such creatures down as it cools their molten exterior, eventually encasing them in a shell of hard earth and rendering them immoble. This is only temporary, however, and depending on the power of the creature, this immobilized state may only last for one hour.
^0eb

- A fragment of text in one book reads:  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Elder elementals have strong connections to the energy of their aspected element. This connection can be so strong that...
^0ec

- The following page is torn out. Read this when the torn out pages are found (see The Old Classroom):  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> ...some of the most powerful elementals have been reported to regenerate themselves completely if destroyed through conventional means. They do this through the vast reservoirs of aspected energy present in areas that have been infused with their elemental aura, normally through extended exposure to the elder elemental.
^0ed

- Finally, the party may come across a few burned pages from an old tome. The pages are badly damaged, almost as if they were saved from a fire, and are kept in a small magical field to prevent further disintegration. Their origin is unknown. The following passage can be made out:  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "After its defeat, the aspect of ice lost a single shard... *the Borealus*... was sealed away... A dance of fire and ice maintains the Wood's balance... if the fire wanes, it must wane slowly, only then will its energies have time to ebb away..."
^0ee

> [!note] Ashsnake Lore
> 
> The ashsnakes were thought to be new to Humblewood, but with a bit of poking around characters can find out that the creatures may have appeared in the past.
> 
> Any player that spends the full amount of days researching Elemental Creatures or The Great Calamity, while also looking for information about ashsnakes, will find a few accounts detailing sightings of similar creatures around the time of the Great Calamity. Although the ashsnakes are definitely related to the element of fire, accounts do not provide enough information to tell whether or not the creatures are elementals, and descriptions of them feeding run exactly counter to this notion, as elementals require neither food nor drink to survive.
^ashsnake-lore

### Conjuration Magic

Any player who picked up on the evidence of conjuration magic in the Grove, possibly from their encounter with the Cloud of Emberbats, could have their character investigate this topic. Other research topics could lead characters here as well. This is a broad category, and even when pared down to tomes on elemental summoning, it would take time to sift through. After four days of research, a character will learn the following:

- Anything as big as the aspect would require huge amounts of energy to seal. It would take tremendous effort on the part of a creature, even one as powerful as the aspect of fire, to break free. This likely couldn't have been done without the seal being weakened by some outside force.  
- A large conjuration circle would be needed in order to seal away anything as massive as the aspect of fire. The circle may have become obscured over time, but it is impossible for the aspect to have been kept dormant all this time without it.  
- After finding the previous piece of information, further research will lead the party to a cryptic tome: a treatise by a conjurer who attempted to calculate the location of the postulated conjuration circle within the Grove. The conjurer's treatise is based on painstaking research on energy readings, topography, ley lines, and other academic esoterica. However, while the complex formulae of his calculations remain, the pages that actually specify the location have been ripped out (see The Old Classroom).  
- Without the missing page, the conjurer's calculations could be worked through to find the location of the circle, but it would be incredibly challenging, taking at least a full day of research by someone proficient in the [Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana) skill. At the end of the day, the researcher must make a DC 21 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. On a success, the character calculates the circle's postulated location in the Grove, which is on its eastern edge, at a point between Winnowing Reach and Alderheart. On a failure, the character must repeat the process, requiring another full day of calculations. Other characters can help with this roll, granting advantage to the character rolling for the check, but only if the supporting characters are also proficient in the [Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana) skill. Professor Birchwalker can also help a character perform the calculations to find the location of the conjuration circle within the Grove.  

![[z_Assets/a29cd68ec63e97f77c85ee3d1aa9ae7c_MD5.webp]]

## Shadows Fall

After the party completes five days of research, Odwald will become nervous. He'll try to use a necromantic ritual ripped from one of the tomes he stole in an attempt to scare the party off. He'll wait until the party members are absorbed in their tasks before acting. When no one is watching him, he will use [greater invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-invisibility.md) to move unseen and unheard between the large stacks, then cast the ritual slowly and quietly. Once Odwald completes the ritual, he'll discard the useless ritual page in a place where the characters can find it, attempting to frame another necromancer on campus. If characters search the area where the shadows appeared, they will find the page. A DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check will reveal the dark runes scratched upon the parchment to be associated with particularly foul necromancy. All the magic in the runes has been spent.

Odwald's ritual curses the characters, causing their [shadow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/shadow.md) to detach and become an undead creature in the character's likeness. The shadows each attack the character to which they are closest, and if in an area of dim light they will use their bonus action to hide immediately before making their attack. Party members in the main areas of the library will be in conditions of bright light, while those between the shelves will be in areas of dim light. If anyone calls for help, Odwald, still disguised as Mordane, will hear it but ignore their pleas.

Once the shadows are defeated, Odwald will arrive and make excuses for his absence at the onset of battle. He'll tell a story about having to return some terribly fragile evocation scrolls to a far-away section of the library. If any characters doubt this story, have them make opposed Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks against Odwald's Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check. Odwald makes this check with advantage. He knows this library like the back of his talon and can easily lead the characters to the exact section where he placed the tomes earlier to set up this alibi.

If a party member succeeds, let it be known Mordane is hiding something, but don't reveal exactly what. A good thing to note is that a party member's success should put him on a list of potential suspects for the strange occurrences on campus, not force the final encounter early. If pressured, Odwald would likely keep up his ruse, and even call security on the party if they try a heavy-handed tactic like resorting to intimidation.

Regardless of the conversation, Odwald will ask if the party requires aid, and if any have been injured he will use his faculty amulet to contact Avium security and medics. The party members will be escorted to the infirmary, where healers will tend to their wounds and examine them with divination magic. The healers will ask any characters who've taken Strength damage to finish a short rest in the infirmary, to make sure the curse of undeath is fully purged. Characters should return to normal after completing a short or long rest.

> [!note] Unmaking the Mystery
> 
> This isn't recommended, but should the decision be made to force the final encounter early—if the party isn't the type for mysteries—this section will detail how they can proceed from this point. Make sure to read everything from The Secret Door to get a rough idea of the dungeon the party will be going into.
> 
> If at any point "Mordane" is presumed to be behind the strange happenings, make sure the disguised Odwald has time to escape from the party (with his spells he should have plenty of ways to evade them). Then, have him flee through his secret passageway, which the party must uncover in order to continue their pursuit.
> 
> The party can even appeal to the Dean for help, as Dean Windsworth would now be forced to agree that something suspicious seems to have happened to Mordane.
> 
> If Odwald made it to his laboratory, he'll stay hidden there, working on his calculations. Because he knows the party is coming, he will have the [cobblefright](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/cobblefright-hwcs.md) guarding The Old Classroom to make it easier for him to escape.
^unmaking-the-mystery

## Mysterious Circumstances

The day after the party's encounter with the shadows, they will be awoken by a knock on their dormitory door. Professor Birchwalker will inform the party that the Dean wishes to see them as soon as possible. The party will find the Dean in his office in a nervous state. He'll ask them to shut the door moments after entering.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Dean Windsworth fixes you with a serious stare and anxiously speaks: "You aren't the first to have an 'incident' in the past few weeks. I... uh, don't mean to alarm you, but several strange things have been reported across campus and... well, this college was made by powerful wizards, and... we haven't really figured out everything those old codgers left hidden here. Magical defenses and the like. We've had a few uh...accidents in the past. I hope that isn't the case...but if it is, well, you folks are the Defenders of Alderheart, right? I can't think of anyone else I'd rather have looking into this."
^0f4

The Dean will elaborate if the characters have questions. He's received odd reports from across campus, and believes them to be the result of some as yet undiscovered magical defense built into the Avium being accidentally triggered. He has a few leads that might help the party find out what's happening. Normally, the Dean would trust such investigations to the Perch Guard, but he has so little to go on at this point that he'd rather not involve them if it turns out to be something minor. If the party mentions anything suspicious on the part of the faculty, the Dean will insist they gather sufficient proof first. He trusts his staff and will need hard evidence before he can even consider the possibility of one of them being to blame. The Dean outlines three leads for the party to follow-up on:

- A poor student, [Figory Figgins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/figory-figgins-hwcs.md), is a skittish jerbeen who recently applied for sick leave. He filed reports about experiencing something unusual and frightening on campus. Most people think he's exaggerating to gain a medical exemption from classes, but the Dean believes something scared Figory. In truth, Figory was attacked by the [cobblefright](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/cobblefright-hwcs.md), and was afflicted when it drained some of his vitality. The party will find Figory in the first year dormitories in the central building, near the ground floor (see The Unnerved Underachiever).  
- [Corvax Revayne](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/corvax-revayne-hwcs.md), a dusk corvum divination instructor, has made cryptic predictions, regarding a bad event that's either going to, or already has happened on the campus. He's a brilliant scholar, but also a bit of an oddball. It would be of great help if the party could check in and see what exactly the old corvum has predicted. It might be related to the events on campus. He has an office in the central building, but he can be found in the divination lab in one of the outer spires (see A Disturbed Diviner).  
- A studious sera luma named [Jell Platena](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jell-platena-hwcs.md) has lodged a complaint about the servitor skeletons on campus acting oddly. It's minor, but it might be worth looking into. Jell doesn't know this, but what she saw was the direct result of Odwald controlling the servitor skeletons to help in his research. She can be found in one of the libraries in the inner spires (see The Apprehensive Apprentice).  

### The Unnerved Underachiever

The party will find Figory in his room. He'll be hesitant to talk with them, as he is accustomed to being bullied by the other students.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The door to the dormitory room opens only a crack, and through it you can see a small eye looking at you nervously. A timid voice squeaks, "Who are you? What do you want?"
^0f6

If the party explains they're here to question Figory, he'll shut the door and ask them to leave. The party can convince him to let them in with a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check or a DC 12 Charisma ([Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check. They can also try a more subtle route, such as claiming they were sent to check up on his health. Figory, really does feel burdened with his secret, but he isn't convinced people will believe him.

Figory looks pale and weak. His face is drained of color and his eyes are heavy, as though he hasn't slept. If the party persuaded their way in or otherwise entered in a non-threatening way, Figory will open up and tell them his story. If they intimidated or otherwise bullied their way in, they'll have to succeed on another [Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) skill check (at the same DC) to get him to speak. On a failure, he won't talk, and if the party continues to push he'll ask them to leave immediately, warning the group that he will call for campus security if they don't. If the party can get him to speak, this is the story Figory tells:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "It was a cold night. It was raining. I—I could hear scratching, like something scraping at the wall outside my window. When I looked out, I saw it. This huge monster was c-c-climbing with its c-claws... It saw me too. It had four eyes. Four big red eyes. It opened its mouth and... I think I passed out. When I woke up I felt sick, and it—it was just gone. You probably think I'm crazy... don't you?"
^0f7

If the party asks around to see if other students heard or saw anything, there will be no corroboration. It was raining heavily, and even Figory will admit to only being able to hear the creature faintly through the downpour. If anyone in the party casts [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) on Figory they will find that he has a faint aura of necromancy about him, as though he was recently affected by necromantic magic.

Figory isn't interested in getting too involved in the investigation. He explains that he has to focus on his health in order to be ready for the next semester, but it would be a great comfort to know the party has caught the creature he saw before it can hurt someone. He will provide them with any information he can before they leave.

If the party examines the outside of the trunk where Figory saw the creature, a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check will be enough to uncover marks on the trunk's surface, as well as a few pieces of bone peeking out of the soft earth.

The marks on the trunk are faded and subtler than one would expect from Figory's story. These are leftover from the transmutation magic Odwald used to cover up the damage done by his escaped cobblefright creation. Any wizard specializing in transmutation can instantly identify magical tampering on the trunk upon examination. Such a character would also be able to tell that whoever covered up these markings wasn't a specialist transmuter: there are differences in the way the magic was used here, and a true master of this magical school could have blended these markings seamlessly. The same information could be discerned by any other character with a DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check.

The bone fragments on the ground can be identified as birdfolk bones with a DC 15 Wisdom ([Medicine](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) or Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check, but the pieces are too small to make out anything else. The bones feel strange to anyone holding them, somehow imparting a sense of unease. Casting [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) on the bones will reveal them to have a strong aura of necromancy.

### A Disturbed Diviner

Professor Revayne is in his classroom, at a table specially prepared for divination. He is performing some kind of ritual with a set of small animal bones when the party enters. The interruption causes him to lose focus and curse at the party, until he realizes they are the Defenders of Alderheart. Then, he is eager for their aid in convincing the Dean to mount an investigation regarding the strange omens he keeps reading in relation to the College. Instead of explaining further, Professor Revayne will demonstrate by performing the [augury](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/augury.md) ritual now.

As he casts the magic, and throws a set of small animal bones inside a prepared ritual circle, they begin to glow. A soft voice speaks, revealing a cryptic clue:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A black heart lies among the white and gray, but in the dimness it is hard to say,
> 
> Who is friend, and who is foe? The master weal, the monster woe.
^0f9

This is what the ritual has revealed every day for the last few weeks. The professor is unsure what to make of it, but he thinks the first line might hint that the threat comes from someone people trust on campus: a student, or perhaps even a faculty member.

If showed the bones from The Unnerved Underachiever, Professor Revayne will cast [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) on them, and report the necromantic aura. This is outside of his area of expertise, but he'll postulate they might be from one of the servitor skeletons that perform menial tasks throughout the school. If the party tells the professor about the creature Figory described, he'll be unnerved and caution them to proceed carefully. Necromancy is only taught in theory at the Avium, and the servitor skeletons are all former faculty members or alumni who willingly donated their remains to the College after a natural death. If anyone were to have created something else, it would surely be cause for alarm. Either way, if Professor Revayne found or heard that the bones appear to have an aura of necromancy about them, he'll direct the party to [Glinda Nightseed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/glinda-nightseed-hwcs.md), a professor of theoretic necromancy (see The Necromancer).

### The Apprehensive Apprentice

It might take the party a bit of time to locate Jell. She's a serious student, and is often on the go from one place to the next for classes, extra credit activities, and her own personal studies. If the party asks around campus, during the day they should be able to find which library she's currently in with a DC 13 Charisma ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. They can also ask the Dean for her dorm room location, where they'll be able to track her down at night, but she might not be in much of a mood to talk at that point.

Once they manage to find a suitable time to speak with her, Jell will tell the party she noticed the servitor skeletons behaving weirdly. This is her story:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Well, I was finishing up an extra credit assignment for Professor Leachwood in the potions lab, when something strange happened. The servitors that were cleaning up the lab stopped, walked out of the lab, and went toward the crossing platform. I was curious, so I followed them. It looked like they were headed into the lower library. I would have followed them down, but I don't have access to the lower levels."
^0fb

Jell filed a notice with the administration that day, but figured it was their doing after she didn't hear anything back. She guesses it might have been a planned drill or maintenance. She won't be able to provide more information than this, but she can point the party to Professor Glinda Nightseed who teaches an advanced course in theoretic necromancy (see The Necromancer). If anyone were to know what was happening with the skeletons, it would be Professor Nightseed.

## Putting the Pieces Together

If the party suspects that the individual they believe to be Mordane Swiftgale is behind the strange happenings, they may begin to investigate him. If Odwald realizes he has come under suspicion, he will try to draw attention to Professor Glinda Nightseed, as she is the perfect scapegoat. Odwald hopes by diverting the party's suspicions, he will buy himself time to continue his experiments in peace. Even if the party is clueless as to Odwald's involvement, or have already spoken to Professor Nightseed, Odwald will attempt to shift their investigation towards her by dropping the following information:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "A few days ago, Professor Nightseed came by with a rather unusual request. It was for the Necronomicon Ex Corvis, a tome of powerful necromancy spells. Normally such dangerous books are not permitted to leave the lower library, but she insisted. Of course, she returned it after studying it for some time, but recently that same tome has gone missing from my shelves. I have been waiting to hear back from the appropriate channels, but it seems that whoever has taken the book wished to leave me shouldering the blame. I have my suspicions, but... I cannot very well level such an accusation at a tenured professor without proof."
^0fd

## The Necromancer

Professor Glinda Nightseed can be found in her office in the main building, or in a classroom in one of the outer spires where she teaches theoretical necromancy. Strictures in the Avium forbid her from practicing necromancy on campus, with the exception of reanimating those who wished to serve the College in death.

Professor Nightseed seems nice enough, if a little strange, and she is a skilled necromancer. But the Professor is hiding a secret that makes her seem very suspicious, especially around the subject of the campus' servitor skeletons. She has been using these legal reanimations to practice new ways of imbuing simple undead creatures with greater faculties, on par with the living. This is gray-area work, definitely bending some of the strictures against necromancy at the Avium, if not breaking the rules outright, and it could cost the professor her job.

If the party has the bones found in The Unnerved Underachiever, Professor Nightseed will be able to tell them that the bones carry a strong aura of necromancy, something dark and sinister. It genuinely spooks her.

If the party mentions the servitor skeletons they heard about in The Apprehensive Apprentice, the professor will become visibly uncomfortable. Professor Nightseed's secret makes her nervous at this point, and she'll simply say she couldn't guess as to why this might be happening. Any player who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check will be able to tell that the professor is lying. Professor Nightseed won't discuss the subject further, and if the party pushes her she'll ask them to leave.

If the party decides to break into Professor Nightseed's office to investigate, they can find a notebook within a locked desk drawer (DC 16 Dexterity check to unlock with [thieves' tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)). The professor's notes will reveal her secret manipulation of the servitor skeletons.

The party will also notice a necromancy tome on the professor's bookshelf. This is the [Necronomicon Ex Corvis](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/necronomicon-ex-corvis-hwcs.md), out of which Odwald tore a page to cast his ritual in Shadows Fall, though it appears to have additional pages missing. Odwald planted the book here to frame Professor Nightseed.

Tomes like the [Necronomicon Ex Corvis](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/necronomicon-ex-corvis-hwcs.md) are dangerous and restricted material on campus. Any character caught with the book risks being banned from the Avium (see Developments).

If confronted by the party, Professor Nightseed will claim to know nothing of how the forbidden book managed to get in her office. She will even go so far as to insist the party hand the book back to her so that she might bring it to the lower library, citing its danger in inexperienced hands.

Should the party have read Glinda's notebook, they can confront her about her experiments. In this case, she will admit to some wrongdoing, but ask the party to keep her experiments a secret. As an expert on both the good and evil sides of necromancy, Professor Nightseed assures them that while her research is not strictly permitted, she is not using any sinister magics to achieve her results. She is simply researching ways to resurrect the dead at a lower cost of both materials and magical energy, and these experiments are key to crafting cutting-edge magics. The impressions remaining within the servitor skeletons may hold the solution to successfully completing her research.

If forced into combat, Professor Nightseed's primary goal is to restrain the heroes and escape to call security. She doesn't wish to kill the party, and will refrain from any spells or tactics that might result in their death.

If the party informs the Dean that they found the [Necronomicon Ex Corvis](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/necronomicon-ex-corvis-hwcs.md) in Professor's Nightseed's office (or convince the Dean to have Perch Guard security search Professor Nightseed's office, where they will surely find the contraband grimoire) the Dean will be satisfied that the party has found the one responsible for summoning the shadows (as the missing page from this book was clearly the one used to cast that ritual), and Professor Nightseed will be imprisoned in the gaol for questioning. The professor will protest her innocence to the last.

If the party has no conclusive evidence linking Professor Nightseed to any wrongdoing on campus, Glinda will be released and the party will be reprimanded by the Dean for their error in judgement. Dean Windsworth will give them another chance, however, as they are still the best hope at finding out who or what is causing these disturbances.

Revealing Professor Nightseed's secret research will result in a less harsh reprimand for the party. The Professor will be released from custody, but her experiments constitute a serious breach of campus rules, and she'll lose her job. Either way, the party had best be certain the next time they accuse a faculty member, since another mistake like this could get them banned from the campus.

## Odwald's Trap

If the party fell for Odwald's framing of Professor Nightseed, it shouldn't take more than an interrogation to discover that she knows nothing of the missing pages. This development is something Odwald hadn't considered, and now he worries that he might have incriminated himself by leading the party to her.

Similarly, if the party has been to visit Glinda but haven't turned her in, Odwald worries it'll only be a matter of time before the suspicion falls on him.

Using various methods of disguise and surveillance, Odwald is keeping an eye on the party as they investigate around campus. The characters might not be aware of it yet, but every person they talk to will unwittingly provide a clue pointing toward Odwald's involvement. Their continued investigation will push an already skittish Odwald over the edge, and prompt him to lay a trap for the party, hoping to put them out of commission for the rest of their stay at the Avium.

A day after the party meets with Glinda Nightseed (if she was not arrested), or two days afterward (if she was arrested), a note will be slipped under the door of the party's dormitory room. Scrawled on the parchment in scratchy letters are the words:

![[z_Assets/a20bd84673f2d1b37c3b643d7e5d791f_MD5.webp]]

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "The Forest Terrarium, Central Building, East Wing. Midnight. Come alone. I know where the missing pages are."
^101

If the party alerts the Dean (or anyone who might tell the Dean), he will attempt to stop them from going, insisting it's too dangerous. The Dean will request the party allow the Perch Guard to handle the situation. The party can refuse, but if the Perch Guard attends the meeting, with or without the party, Odwald will abandon his trap (skip to The Secret Door). If the party arrives at the terrarium unaccompanied, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> It is a dark, moonless night as you step onto the large floating disc that houses the Forest Terrarium. You find yourself in an unusual woodland with several types of trees that don't look quite right beside one another. In the center of this place is a building, made up of a great central dome which branches off into two semi-spherical wings on either side. The night is deathly quiet.
^102

Anyone can make a DC 12 Intelligence ([Nature](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) or Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to discover these trees don't naturally grow next to one another. Some might even have been altered by magic. The central building has no door, simply a wide archway that leads into the interior of the domed structure. This is a museum, and behind glass panels the party can see fossils, as well as magical recreations of extinct plants. The west and east wing both contain fossils and skeletons of animals from different points in the natural history of Humblewood. The sound of chanting carries over from the east wing. When the party enters the east wing read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You see a shadow moving in the distance, and hear the sound of sharp footfalls on the smooth stone floor. Suddenly, two elk skeletons flash with crackling, dark energy, and burst from their glass confines. They circle your party.
^103

Use the stat block for a [minotaur skeleton](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/minotaur-skeleton.md) to determine the fighting capabilities of the elk skeletons. Replace the minotaur's greataxe attack with a hoof attack that deals the same amount of bludgeoning damage. The skeletons will attack the nearest targets, and pursue any characters who flee if there isn't at least one character to keep their attention in the main room.

At the start of the elk encounter, the party catches a glimpse of someone fleeing. The retreating figure is an undisguised Odwald, who needed to be nearby to reanimate the skeletons. Odwald's robes are enough to conceal his features, but any character within 5 feet of him will be able to tell he is a corvum. If anyone follows the sound of his footsteps, they will end up outside where they witness a dark hooded figure leap from the terrarium's edge, feathered arms outstretched. Within a round, Odwald will use a scroll of [fly](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fly.md) he has prepared to hide in the darkness within the rotating spires of the College. From there he can use [greater invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-invisibility.md) to guarantee his escape. If forced to defend himself, Odwald will fight, looking to end things quickly while making his escape. While not intent on killing anyone, Odwald isn't opposed to seriously injuring his opponents. All the better if it slows down their investigation.

After combat, characters will be able to search the Forest Terrarium for clues. Any character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check will discover a scroll which was accidentally dropped by Odwald in his retreat. This heavy vellum scroll bears necromantic symbols. It is also clearly marked as material belonging in the lower library. A character can attempt a DC 18 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check to decipher the spell, but a Wizard of the Necromancy Arcane Tradition rolls with advantage. On a success, the character will deduce that these sigils form a spell designed to control large numbers of simple undead, such as the Avium's servitor skeletons. Characters who fail this check can take this scroll to Professor Nightseed (if she hasn't been arrested) or to the Dean, either of whom will be able to decipher it and tell the party that this is scroll forbidden to leave the library. Furthermore, it looks to have been altered by a highly skilled mage to enhance its effectiveness.

## The Secret Door

The goal of the events at the Avium is to lead the players to this point. If they've completed enough of the above tasks, they should have sufficient clues to understand there is necromancy at play on campus, the culprit is a faculty member, and the mystery leads to the lower library.

If the party needs more help, have Dean Windsworth call them up to discuss their progress. Once he hears their evidence, he could reasonably conclude the lower library is a good place to investigate further, and he can even point them toward some of the older documents about the Avium's construction for clues as to what he still desperately wants to believe is just a malfunctioning magical defense.

If the party decides to investigate the lower library, they can find what they're looking for in one of three ways:

***If the party spends a full day stealthily staking out Mordane Swiftgale,*** they may catch him sneaking off behind some shelves, which could lead them to the wall with the hidden door. This requires a group Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check against DC 14. Reduce the DC to 10 if Glinda was apprehended, as Odwald will be less careful with a scapegoat behind bars. Either way, if the party fails this check, Odwald will notice their efforts and not use the secret entrance.

***If the party spends a day in the lower library,*** they will notice some of the servitor skeletons abruptly stop their programmed tasks. Should the characters follow the skeletons closely, the skeletons will lead them to a wall that appears to be a dead end, but which actually hides a secret door.

***If the party researches the documents on the Avium's construction,*** after a day of research, the party will find an old scroll with lower library blueprints that show plans for lower level classrooms and laboratories. It's hard to tell from the blueprints if these were ever built. The area indicated on the plans is bricked off and is now a wall.

Regardless of how they are led to the wall in the lower library, investigating it with a successful DC 15 [Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation) check will reveal a hidden door. The door opens when pushed inward, causing a stone slab to recede into a groove, revealing a secret path. Some hidden mechanism resets the door after five seconds have passed, but there is enough time for everyone to make it through before it closes. A lever on the opposite side of the door can be used to open it again. Once the party makes it through the door, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You and your companions find yourselves in a small hallway, dimly-lit by motes of magical light which float in slow, random patterns near the passageway's ceiling. The hall before you continues downward into darkness. Twenty feet ahead, to your left, a door has been left ajar.
^105

This hallway is 10 feet wide and 100 feet long. The magical motes follow the party through the area, continually providing them with dim light. As the hallway proceeds, it turns at regular intervals until it ends at a closed door. Light is streaming from the crack beneath it (see The Old Classroom).

The open door leads to a small room that looks like an office (see The Study Room).

## The Study Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This small stone room smells musty and old. Bookshelves line the walls, though they are mainly empty, and there is a table against the right wall. A cushioned chair sits in the middle of the room. Most of the furniture is old, except for the chair, which appears to be a new addition. A simple wooden door lies to the left.
^107

When the characters enter the study, they will notice that it's clean, and appears to have seen recent use. The wooden door to the left of the entrance opens into a closet, which contains the real librarian, Mordane Swiftgale. Mordane is standing upright, though his eyes are closed as if he is sleeping, and he's surrounded by a field of swirling gray energy, which has a jelly-like viscosity when touched. He does not appear to be breathing. If Mordane is checked for a pulse, a character will find that he is alive, but his pulse is beating at an incredibly slow rate. It is obvious he's being kept alive and imprisoned by this magic, but a DC 18 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check is required for a character to figure out that necromancy is involved, and that it's holding Mordane in a state of suspended animation. This effect can be dispelled, and counts as a 4th level spell for the purposes of determining the DC of [dispel magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md).

A crystal pendant hangs from a hook on the inside of the closet door. The pendant looks familiar, and any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence check, or who has the Sharp Mind trait, will recognize it as the one worn by the birdfolk they know as Mordane. Analyzing the pendant reveals it to possess both moderate transmutation and illusion auras. Anyone who puts on the pendant assumes the appearance of Mordane Swiftgale, and an examination of the character in this form will reveal no magical aura of any kind until the pendant is removed.

The doorway that led into the study is the only exit, and will lead players back to the main hallway.

## The Old Classroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you and your companions travel down the dim hall, you are met with the unmistakable smell of death. There's no ambient sound here, aside from your own footsteps. You pass by empty rooms, all of which look to have been long abandoned, but soft candlelight seeps out from beneath a closed door at the end of the hallway.
^109

The hallway within 20 feet of the wooden door is guarded by a permanent [alarm](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/alarm.md) spell, and if the alarm is triggered Odwald will receive a silent signal in his mind.

A character that sneaks up to the door without triggering the alarm and presses their ear against the door can hear soft, incomprehensible speech, as if someone is muttering, along with strange clacking noises and a hollow scraping sound. If a character triggers the alarm, however, there will be nothing but eerie silence.

The door opens into 40-foot-wide, 80-foot-long classroom containing Odwald and five [birdfolk skeletons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/birdfolk-skeleton-hwcs.md). There is a passageway to the west of Odwald's desk that leads into darkness. The servitor skeletons are under his control, and he had them working on various blackboards set up around the room, writing out arcane equations.

***If the alarm was triggered,*** Odwald will have pulled his skeletons away from their calculations into defensive positions. He won't send his minions out to attack the party, but he and his undead servants will be ready for them when they open the door. The party will begin combat surprised.

***If the alarm wasn't triggered,*** Odwald will be surprised at the beginning of combat, and will be found seated at a paper strewn desk, doing calculations. His skeletons will still be at their chalkboards when the party opens the door. Odwald can command the skeletons to defend him as a bonus action on his turn.

***If the party is aware of the alarm,*** through [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) or a similar effect, they can plan to storm the room to try and catch Odwald off guard. If they do this, Odwald will not be surprised, as his alarm will still trigger, but he won't have had time to pull his skeletons into defensive positions either. Roll initiative as normal.

After a round of combat, Odwald will make for the passageway to the left, which leads to a staircase. His primary goal is escape, but he may throw out a spell or two before he does so in order to keep the party off-balance while they fight his minions. If things are looking particularly bad for Odwald he'll use [greater invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-invisibility.md) to protect himself as he flees. Once Odwald has fled, the skeletons will bar entry to the passageway, lashing out at the party with rusty weapons and sharp, bony talons.

> [!note] Treasure
> 
> In the old classroom, the party finds some of the missing pages (see Into the Library) on the desk. However, it's clear he's taken some crucial information with him. If they take at least an hour to look through everything here, the party will also have enough information to discover the culprit's name: Odwald Ebonhart.
^treasure

If the party defeats or captures Odwald in **The Old Classroom**, then the [cobblefright](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/cobblefright-hwcs.md), no longer able to feel its master's control, will climb the stairs to investigate. Freed from Odwald's command, the cobblefright is hungry for the character's life energy, and any characters attempting to take a short rest in the classroom will soon find it interrupted.

Once the fight with the cobblefright has been concluded, refer to the developments section (see Developments) to see what happens.

## The Secret Laboratory

The stairway that Odwald fled through leads from The Old Classroom) down to his laboratory. If the party follows Odwald immediately after the previous encounter, they will be able to engage him there, though they may be surprised to find that he isn't alone. the [cobblefright](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/cobblefright-hwcs.md) he created lurks in the darkness.

Refer to Fig. 4.2 for a map of the Secret Laboratory.

> When the party descends to Odwald's Lab, have them start in the space marked with a white "X." Suggested placements for Odwald and his cobblefright are shown for ease of play. If Odwald flees from the laboratory, he will head through the door marked with a red asterisk (*) and down the spiral staircase to the tunnels and passages below the College.
^using-the-secret-laboratory-map

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You find yourself in a macabre laboratory. An assortment of bones lays strewn across the tables, and foul-smelling liquids bubble in pots. The stench of death is gut-wrenching. A terrifying creature lurches towards you, a hulking monstrosity of bone and sinew. It appears to be comprised of hundreds of birdfolk bones, jumbled together to form a roughly humanoid shape. The arms end in several talons intertwined into circular claws, and the creature's face is made from the top halves of two birdfolk skulls, one atop the other. It gazes at you with its four empty red eyes and emits a shriek.
^10d

As long as Odwald is near, the cobblefright won't go on the offensive unless the order is given, but it stands ready to defend itself or its master. Have Odwald say:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "You don't understand what you're doing. Stay out of my way!"
^10e

Given the chance, Odwald will explain his plans, detailing his creation of the cobblefright from deceased birdfolk, and telling of how he stole the information he needed to stop the aspect. The aspect is immortal, and the only sure way to defeat it for good is to drain its vital energies through necromancy. To Odwald, stopping the aspect is worth any risk. He is condescending to the party at every opportunity. He is arrogant, and doesn't think the Defenders of Alderheart could possibly understand what he sees as necessary steps to stop the aspect. He is also deeply afraid for the future of the Wood, and doesn't believe the party can be trusted to defeat the aspect on their own.

Depending on if the party hears him out or not, it may be possible to talk Odwald out of moving forward with his plan. Even if they may not be able to argue logic with Odwald, he might listen if the party can make an emotional appeal. Though Odwald acts as if his plan has been well-considered, he is entirely motivated by fear, and he hasn't actually given himself time to think through the consequences of his actions. Any character who can convince him that he's not thinking clearly may help him recognize his folly.

If the party manages to reason with him, create tension by having Odwald lose control of the cobblefright just as he is about to surrender quietly. Fearing for his life, Odwald's cowardice will compel him to flee, apologizing as he leaves the party to fight his mistake. Though, if reasoned with, Odwald will return after the battle to face his demons, and offer to let the party turn him in to the Dean.

If the party attacks Odwald, or fails to reason with him, he will order the cobblefright to hold them off while he flees. Though he intends for the cobblefright to do this nonlethally, the creature's corrupted and evil nature will cause it to attack with maximum violence.

Should the players have difficulty with this fight, have Odwald experience a change of heart and come back to assist against the cobblefright. With this change of heart, Odwald will allow the party to turn him over to the authorities.

If a character attempts to capture a retreating Odwald, allow the character following him as he flees to try and catch up to him, but give Odwald a 60-foot head-start. Odwald won't bother attacking his pursuer unless it's absolutely necessary to avoid capture. Instead, he will turn [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) and attempt to lose any character chasing him in the winding passageways.

> [!note] Treasure

> The Defenders of Alderheart are celebrated for uncovering Oadwald's scheme and putting a stop to his creation before things got any worse. The real Mordane will thank them personally for freeing him.
> 
> Provided that the characters broke none of the Avium's rules, the Dean welcomes each character back to study, seek information in the libraries, or even to teach a class if they possess the requisite skills and interest to do so. Additionally, the Dean offers a [ring of spell storing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/ring-of-spell-storing.md), which contains the [stellar bodies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/stellar-bodies-hwcs.md) spell, cast by him at 5th level, along with two [potions of resistance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-resistance.md) which grant resistance to fire damage. He hopes these will help in the party's quest to save Humblewood from the aspect's fury.
> 
> The Dean will also grant the party the sigil sequence to a secret teleportation circle within the College, as well as an amulet emblazoned with the Avium's crest, which allows them faculty-level access to campus resources. The Avium is home to the only teleportation circle in Humblewood, which is a closely-guarded secret. Those who learn this sequence can teleport to the Avium using the magic contained in their faculty-level amulets, but this can only be done once per day, and only to return to the Avium's teleportation circle. Upon arrival by way of the circle, campus security will demand they show their faculty amulet for identification.

## Developments

***If any character was caught with the* Necronomicon Ex Corvis** (This is the book that Odwald planted in Professor Glinda Nightseed's office, see The Necromancer), they will not receive the faculty-level amulet and teleportation circle sequence and will be informed that they have been banned from the Avium. Other party members may suffer the same fate for failing to report such a dangerous tome and return it to those trained in its proper care. At the Dean's behest, any banned characters may be granted restricted, temporary access to the Avium. The Avium will still provide any aid the Defenders of Alderheart might require to quell the threat of the aspect, but only under strict supervision. After the aspect is dealt with, anyone banned from the College will no longer be welcomed at the Avium. The characters can protest, but while the Dean is sympathetic, he'll ultimately uphold the rules of the institution.

***If Odwald has been apprehended,*** the Dean will express shock and disappointment that a brilliant alumni of the College would perpetrate such heinous actions under his beak. However, as Odwald explains the gravity of the situation, the Dean will take a moment to consider. Odwald will mention his research has yielded results: if the aspect can't be destroyed, the party may be able to re-seal it in such a way that its harmful energies are contained. It's a long shot, but he knows a seer of great talent, who can help them find an item that could theoretically be used to stop the aspect. Should they allow him some time to rest, he can locate her and help the party bring an end to this menace.

It's up to the party whether or not they accept Odwald's help, but Dean Windsworth will advise that this could represent the best option for success, even if they don't like the idea of teaming up with Odwald. For his part, the Dean will ensure the necromancer is held in custody, and he will make sure Odwald faces judgement before the Council at Alderheart for his crimes. Odwald will accept whatever consequences his actions have brought, so long as the party promises to stop the aspect before it destroys the Wood.

***If Odwald was slain,*** it will take some time for his background and the full scope of his research to be uncovered. However, it's clear from the evidence gathered that he had an interest in researching the aspect. The Dean will task his best scholars with studying the old corvum's notes. They will contact the party when they've found something.

***If Odwald escaped,*** the Dean will encourage the party to find him in order to uncover what else he knows, as well as to prevent him from continuing his dangerous research somewhere else.
