In this part, the party will learn how to quell the aspect of fire's rage, and of a dungeon hidden somewhere within the Scorched Grove. There, a mystic staff known as [the Borealus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/borealus-hwcs.md) waits for someone worthy to wield its frozen power. Once obtained, *the Borealus* can help the party seal the creature and its harmful energies away properly, healing the imbalance in the Wood. Not many know about the ancient myth of *the Borealus* or its resting place. While [Odwald Ebonhart](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/odwald-ebonhart-hwcs.md) managed to theorize how one might use this item to re-seal the aspect, he isn't sure how this would work in practice, or if *the Borealus* even truly exists. Pursuing the staff is a gamble, but without any other recourse, the mythic weapon might be the last hope to save the Wood from fiery ruin.

How this part of the adventure plays out depends on the choices the party made up until now, beginning with whether or not Odwald was killed, apprehended, or if he escaped in Developments.

Unless Odwald escaped, give the players a few days of downtime. The Dean will take the time to consider Odwald's fate. If Odwald died, use the same downtime to allow the Dean and his scholars to pore over the deceased Odwald's notes as they try to discover what he was up to. During this time the party is free to avail themselves of the potions lab or the spell libraries on campus (see Exploring the Avium). Since the party can teleport back to the Avium (unless they've been banned for life), use this time to deal with character hooks or plotlines. After the party members have finished with their activities, the Dean will summon the party to his office to discuss what he's learned.

## Odwald's Fate

***If Odwald escaped,*** the party will be told that there's no time to waste. The Dean has launched an investigation into Odwald's lab, and his scribes are examining the materials left behind, but there appear to be some notes missing. It's probable Odwald took them with him when he fled. Odwald must be found (skip to Finding the Necromancer). Since it's likely that the party will need to form an alliance with Odwald if he is captured, it's recommended to read If Odwald was apprehended. Much of this information will still be relevant later, so use it as a reference for character interactions with Odwald as the events of this part of the adventure unfold.

***If Odwald was slain,*** the Dean will uncover some interesting information concerning Odwald's background. He'll inform the players that Odwald is a member of the illustrious and noble Ebonhart family from Alderheart. He was an adventurer in his past, as well as an alumnus of the Avium. The Dean appears saddened that such a prestigious scholar turned to the dark arts. According to Odwald's notes, he blamed himself for the awakening of the aspect, but the details of how Odwald might have been involved are unclear. Among them, however, are scrawlings of a prophecy predicting that a member of the Ebonhart family would be the one to finally heal the Wood from the effects of the Great Calamity.

In his research, Odwald also found writings about a mystical artifact called *the Borealus*, which was hidden sometime after the Great Calamity. He discovered records of its creation, penned by the wizard who crafted, stored it in the Avium's lower library. Using these valuable notes, Odwald theorized a ritual that might utilize this artifact's power to seal the aspect of fire. He had abandoned the ritual in favor of the cobblefright, because he couldn't ascertain whether or not the records of the artifact were genuine. However, scribbles in the margins of his notebook hint that he was considering contacting someone he knew from his adventuring days to help him divine its location.

At this point, *the Borealus* may be the best lead the party has for a way to defeat the aspect. The Dean will ask them to travel to Alderheart and speak with the companion mentioned in Odwald's notes, a hedge witch named [Susan of the Swamp](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/susan-of-the-swamp-hwcs.md) (if Susan is dead, see the Should the Worst Have Happened). While they do this, the Dean will look over the formulae Odwald used, to see if he might be able to perform this ritual. However, the ritual clearly won't work without the power of *the Borealus* (skip to Susan the Seer).

If the players wish to inform [Riffin, the Ash-Knight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/riffin-the-ash-knight-hwcs.md) of Odwald's demise, have them run into him in Alderheart. He is once again at the Wooden Flagon, retracing his steps in the hopes of meeting Odwald along the way. Riffin will be saddened to hear about the loss of his friend, but he will remain confident that even if Odwald seemed bad, he had a good heart. Riffin will offer to help the party in any way he can, something which may become necessary in Facing the Aspect.

If Odwald was apprehended, the party will receive a summons from the Dean to convene in his office. When the party arrives Odwald will be there, waiting beside Dean Windsworth. Odwald has some kind of silver bangles affixed to his wrists, which the Dean explains are necessary to prevent Odwald from using magic.

The old corvum wishes to pursue a lead that could reveal the location of a magical artifact called *the Borealus*, a weapon that may seal away the aspect's energies and return it to a dormant state beneath the Grove. It was a coincidence that Odwald stumbled upon historical accounts of this artifact, and while he isn't convinced it exists or whether the ritual he's created will work, it's the only thing he can think of that might stop the aspect from continually being reborn.

The Council has granted Odwald permission to join the party in order to follow up on this lead. He is to stay within sight of the party at all times, until the aspect of fire has been dealt with. Afterwards, Odwald must be brought to Alderheart for trial and sentencing. Characters may have reservations about teaming up with Odwald, but there's no other choice. The Dean is clearly suspicious of Odwald, but the necromancer's research has granted him a situational awareness that the Dean would need time to grasp. Furthermore, Odwald's past experience as an adventurer means he knows his way around the Wood. If Odwald attempts to flee, the party is to apprehend him at once and deliver him to Alderheart.

> [!note] Odwald's Story
> 
> If the party apprehends Odwald, once given leave to assist the party, Odwald will help them willingly. Time has made him reflect on his actions, and he feels great shame. He is now committed to fixing his mistakes in the right way. Odwald will offer the party every assistance they might require, and he will even share a bit about his background to any characters who are curious.
> 
> During their travels, determine when it fits the narrative flow for Odwald to share information regarding his family, researching *the Borealus*, and his longtime friend, Riffin.
> 
> When role-playing Odwald, remember that he is prideful and cowardly, but also intelligent and deeply concerned for the well-being of the Wood. He sees everything that has happened up to now as a personal failing, and while he's finally willing to ask others for help, in the end, he still feels responsible for the current state of the Wood.
^odwalds-story

### Odwald's Family

Odwald is a member of the noble Ebonhart family, one of the founding families of Alderheart.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "My family holds a generations-old prophecy that an Ebonhart will be the one to finally heal the Wood from the Great Calamity that birthed the Scorched Grove. For many years I believed it would be me, but the more I learned, the less I knew about the fundamental nature of the problem. Six months ago I was granted a vision. An entity visited me in a dream and imparted knowledge of the aspect's existence. It showed me the location of the seal, and told me of the spells I might use to heal the Grove of the aspect's influence once and for all."
^116

The entity that spoke to Odwald in his dream kept its true form hidden. All he could hear was a voice that sounded very old and felt wise beyond the understanding of any mortal. He went to the conjuration circle in the Grove and found it unusually active, as if it was already weakening. He panicked, and used the spells he was shown to try and cleanse the aspect's energy. Instead, the sigil flared up, and shortly thereafter the fires began to spread.

If asked why he did it, Odwald will reply:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I was a damned fool. All these years I've spent, afraid of failing to live up to my family's name. It was this same fear that caused me to act so recklessly. I should never have listened to that blasted voice... and now my actions may have doomed Humblewood."
^117

### Researching the Borealus

If any characters ask Odwald about his knowledge of *the Borealus*, he will relate the following points of information:

- He stumbled across an old legend mentioning *the Borealus* many years ago, but it was only since returning to the Avium that he managed to find a collection of laboratory notes claiming to be from the wizard who crafted it.  
- Because of these notes, Odwald concedes that such an item could have been created. If it was indeed constructed, its power would not only be tremendous, but also uniquely suited to counter the elemental energies of the aspect.  
- Based on his research, he has theorized a way to use *the Borealus* along with the conjuration circle to re-seal the aspect. However, this isn't something he could test, and coupled with the uncertainty of *the Borealus'* existence, it seemed like this avenue had too small a chance of success.  
- Since his recent research on spellcrafting (trying to create a spell that mimics the cobblefright's siphon soul ability), he has hit upon some new documents, which have increased his confidence in the chances of success for a ritual using *the Borealus*... but there's still no way to be sure.  

Odwald will add that this gamble may be the Wood's last hope, as his studies have indicated the aspect will continue to grow in strength the longer it remains un-sealed. He only hopes that *the Borealus* still resides in the Wood, because their time is short.

### Friendship with Riffin

If any player asks about Riffin, or brings up that the strig knight has been looking for Odwald, he will evince a combination of relief and sorrow. He and Riffin were once adventurers who traveled Humblewood together. Odwald was staying with Riffin in Ashbarrow when the fires claimed it. He and Riffin helped people evacuate, but during the chaos a building collapsed and seriously injured Riffin. Odwald saved him and brought him to Alderheart. Burdened as Odwald was by the knowledge that he was responsible for the fires that destroyed Riffin's home, he couldn't bear to stay.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "It was then I resolved to find a way to correct my mistakes, by any means necessary. It seems all I've succeeded in doing is hurting others. I should have asked for help but... perhaps I couldn't accept the idea that it wasn't possible to quell the aspect alone." He scoffs, "My own selfish pride as a chosen son of Ebonhart is to blame. I am truly sorry for the way I acted toward you all."
^11a

Odwald still feels great shame because of his actions, but he will acknowledge that he needs to make amends with Riffin. Besides, Riffin is a capable warrior, and his assistance might prove valuable if they are to face the aspect. Odwald has a good idea where his old friend might be found (skip to The Perch of Brackenmill).

If the subject of Riffin never comes up, Odwald will suggest the party meet with one of his old adventuring companions, a hedge witch by the name of Susan, who may be able to help point the party toward the location of *the Borealus* (skip to Susan the Seer).

> [!note] Should the Worst Have Happened
> 
> If Susan is dead, direct the party to [Ardwyn, Elder of Meadowfen](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ardwyn-elder-of-meadowfen-hwcs.md) from Part 1: The Adventure Begins instead. She was once a formidable priestess of Tyton, and back in Odwald's adventuring days she was known as a talented seer. She should be able to perform a similar ritual to guide the party to *the Borealus'* resting place.
^should-the-worst-have-happened

### Leaving the Avium

When the party leaves the Avium, they should be armed with knowledge about the terrifying and deathless nature of the aspect of fire, but also with a clear view of its weaknesses. Depending on what happened to Odwald, they may have a sense of where to look for leads regarding the location of *the Borealus*.

## Finding the Necromancer

If Odwald escaped in Part 4, then the party's next step is to track him down before he can start more trouble. Have Dean Windsworth or another character impress upon the party that Odwald might have absconded with information from the Avium that could help defeat the aspect once and for all. Therefore, it's important he be captured alive. To help the party achieve this, the Dean will give them a pair of silver bangles, which can be affixed to Odwald to prevent him from using magic. The party's mission is still to quell the aspect, and while Odwald must face justice, the safety of the Wood comes first. Once they apprehend Odwald they are to return him to the Avium for questioning.

### A Divination Ritual

The Dean has informed his most learned professors of the party's situation, and many have offered to help in any way they can. Particularly, the divination professor, [Corvax Revayne](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/corvax-revayne-hwcs.md), may be able to locate Odwald. The party can meet with Professor Revayne in his office, where he has already made the necessary preparations.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Inside this small office, the furniture has been pushed aside to make space for an intricate chalk circle drawn with several flourishes on the flat stone floor. Professor Revayne, still sketching symbols around the circle's edge, is startled by your approach and immediately stands to address you. "Be careful! This circle must reflect the many threads of fate in order to show what is possible. Erase any of them and we risk inaccuracy!" He then motions for you to move to the edges of the room.
^11f

Once he finishes a few strokes, or fills in any lines a hapless character may have stepped on, grumbling as he does so, he will lightly hop into the center of the circle. He asks that someone pass him his tools: a crystal on a string, a bowl of water, and a bag of sand, all of which are easily accessible on the nearby table. Professor Revayne carefully places the bowl of water in the center of the circle, and requests silence while he works. He will suspend the crystal over the bowl and begin to incant his spell.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The air in the room crackles with arcane energy as the pendulum swings back and forth over the bowl of water, which reflects the crystal above like a mirror. The corvum's eyes glow white as he casts a small pinch of sand into the water. It ripples, and images begin to form on its surface. As the pendulum is pulled strongly southeast by an invisible force, you can see tree-farms, wagons filled with goods, and corrals of giant insects. With a gentle "swoosh" the circle of chalk lifts from the ground and disappears into vapour, returning both the bowl of water and the professor to normal.
^120

Professor Revayne will inform the party that Odwald is in Brackenmill. This place appears to have personal significance to Odwald, though the professor can't guess what it might be. However, the professor is certain the necromancer's form will be veiled in concealing magic. Professor Revayne will also impart that someone else in Brackenmill is looking for Odwald. There was a winged shield in his vision: the one who bears this shield is the key to finding Odwald.

He will also remind the party that the augury he performed in A Disturbed Diviner ("the master weal, the monster woe") might mean Odwald is a potential ally. He'll caution them against making any rash moves against Odwald, as his vision gave him the impression the necromancer might yet have a part to play in the fate of the Wood.

The professor will also provide the party with a [gem of seeing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/gem-of-seeing.md). This variant of the item grants only the effects of [see invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/see-invisibility.md) rather than [truesight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#truesight), and it does not regain charges at dawn. Once all its charges have been expended it will become a normal, non-magical gem. Professor Revayne will point out that this item could come in handy if the necromancer attempts to use [invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md) to escape (as he may have done in their first encounter).

### Odwald's Disguise

Armed with new knowledge, players can prepare to set out from the Avium, though it will take about three days on the road to reach Brackenmill. Have this trip be uneventful in order to keep up the game's pace, but hint at the growing power of the aspect by mentioning that the air is much warmer and drier than it was when the party began their journey. The forest also appears quieter than usual as they travel. These are dire times indeed.

Since his escape from the Avium, Odwald has reached Brackenmill, where he now weighs his options. His research has been set back to zero, he has none of his materials or laboratory equipment, and while he harbors some idea of how to stop the aspect he isn't certain the artifact even exists, let alone if its powers are truly as strong as he's read. After having had time to reflect, he is painfully aware of the danger he posed to the innocent people at the College. He has also spotted his old friend Riffin in Brackenmill, and a part of him desperately seeks to confess his misdeeds to the strig knight. However, Odwald lacks courage and will simply be trying to lay low. When the Defenders of Alderheart arrive, he is contemplating his next steps.

Odwald is using [disguise self](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) to pose as a traveling huden gallus monk, staying at the Sunny Silkworm Inn. He must limit his interactions with others due to the nature of the spell, but the form he has chosen roughly matches his own size, so the spell is difficult to uncover at a glance. Any player that specifically examines Odwald can make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to see if something is amiss; for example, if a part of his vestments passes through a table as he moves by. Any physical interaction with Odwald would be enough to detect his illusion, so he'll do his best to deny the party that opportunity by keeping his distance. Odwald endeavours to stay in his rented lodgings for as long as he can, only making appearances in the inn's common room or around town in short intervals, since he must hide and re-cast his spell each hour to maintain its effect. Any player able to scan Odwald with [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) will instantly know he is under the effect of an illusion spell.

If he ever feels as though he has been discovered, Odwald will attempt to flee into the forest.

### The Perch of Brackenmill

When the party reaches Brackenmill, they'll find themselves looking up at a series of lush tree canopies. These will be immediately recognizable as perch-farms; the boughs are filled with familiar herbs, fruiting vines, and are tended by several farmers. Corrals on the ground house different varieties of giant insects, including giant silkworms, munching on greenery.

Brackenmill is a lively hub for folks of all kinds, and upon seeing travelers, folks will smile and greet them politely, welcoming them to their perch. Steps shaped into the tall trees allow players to climb up to a series of bridges made of wood and rope, and platforms that serve to connect the trees together.

The locals here are a hearty folk, and while busy, they exude a kind of rustic hospitality that is honest and charming. If any characters ask about life in Brackenmill of late, locals will tell them that things have been busy. This season, people have had to work even harder than usual to produce enough crops to aid those displaced by the fires. Moreover, it has been so dry that crops require more care to keep them green and healthy. Some of the Tenders have helped by nourishing the plants with their magic, but such services are in short supply. It's been a hard year, and everyone is overworked.

***If the party has come here with Odwald looking for Riffin,*** Odwald will suggest heading to The Sunny Silkworm.

***If the characters offer to assist the farmers,*** provide the party an opportunity to glimpse Odwald in disguise as he passes by. To speed up the pace, have the character make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to notice some malfunction in Odwald's illusion.

***If a character who succeeded on this check attempts to call attention to Odwald in a friendly manner,*** Odwald will ignore them and walk hastily back to the safety of his room at The Sunny Silkworm.

***If Odwald is called out in a way that suggests the character is suspicious of him,*** Odwald makes for the forest as fast as he can (skip to A Confrontation).

***If the characters ask around for clues about any strange travelers entering town,*** the locals won't be much help. People come and go everyday, after all, transporting goods and materials between the various perches that depend on Brackenmill's tree-farms. Folk will point the players toward the local inn, The Sunny Silkworm, which lies near the center of town. Many travelers frequent it, and some even pay to keep rooms in permanent reserve.

### The Sunny Silkworm

The Sunny Silkworm is a large inn and tavern housed in an expansive, circular wooden building in the center of Brackenmill's sprawl. The building rests on a disk-shaped wooden platform seated within the gnarled branches of a great tree that has been shaped around it. Different bridges connect with the wooden platform to allow travel from all around Brackenmill. The place looks cozy and inviting, and players who approach will notice a wooden sign above the door with a smiling silkworm munching on a leaf. Pleasant-smelling smoke wafts from the large chimneys that emerge from its quaint thatched roof. The inn is usually bustling, and today is no exception. When the party enters the building, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The common room of this inn and tavern teems with activity. Many birdfolk and humblefolk of all descriptions are engaged in talk, drink, and games. Three large hearths frame the space, one to the right, another in a stone chimney which rises in the center of the common room, and one behind the bar counter at the back of the common room, over which pots of stew bubble away aromatically. The place is warm and inviting.
^124

The party will find Riffin in the inn's common room, sitting at a small table next to the large central hearth, where he is engaged in a game of cards.

***If the party came here with Odwald,*** they will likely be searching for Riffin so that Odwald can explain himself to his old friend. Once they find Riffin, skip to Riffin and Odwald.

***If the party came here looking for Odwald,*** they'll find Riffin is still looking for him as well. After checking many of their old haunts, Riffin decided it's best to wait at the Sunny Silkworm, rather than risk missing his friend in roving. After all, this was where they always ended up when they traveled together; he's hoping to run into Odwald eventually if he stays long enough. If the characters interacted with Riffin at the Wooden Flagon in Alderheart, he'll recognize the party once they enter and excuse himself from his table to greet them.

***If the party never spoke to Riffin,*** he will recognize them from the battle at the Bandit Camp, as well as from stories he's heard about their exploits since that battle. By now, they surely sound like honorable and upstanding folk to the strig knight, and he'll introduce himself in a familiar tone (they fought alongside each other, after all).

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Hullo again, friends! Looks like you've grown into fine adventurers. 'Defenders of Alderheart' even!" he'll say with a friendly chuckle. "Would ya care for a drink? I'd love a chance to catch up."
^125

If for some reason the party has gained a negative reputation, Riffin will still wish to talk with them, but his response will be a little more subdued.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
>  A familiar looking strig knight waves you over as you enter. "By Tyton's stars, it looks like you've grown a fair sight since that hubbub at the bandit camp." he'll say with a chuckle. "Would ya care for a drink? It's not every day you see the Defenders of Alderheart up close."
^126

In this case, Riffin will explain that he's come here looking for his friend, Odwald. Refer to Seeking out the Ash-Knight to determine how he would react to the party, and how he would answer questions about his journey to find his friend.

Should the party try to explain to Riffin what Odwald's been up to, he will politely insist they must be mistaken. Odwald might have gotten himself into some tough scrapes before, but he would never act in such a reckless and hurtful manner. If the party decides to press the point, Riffin will excuse himself, maintaining that they don't know what they're talking about. He and Odwald have known each other for years, and this doesn't sound like him.

So long as the party doesn't do anything to really offend Riffin, he will be able to provide some useful information. Though he hasn't seen Odwald, he has noticed a few lodgers who don't seem very friendly. He'll point some of them out:

- A surly luma sorcerer who wants to be left alone. She doesn't wish to explain why to a stranger.  
- A stoic strig barbarian who seems cold and expressionless, unless someone in the party strikes up a conversation about weapons, at which point he becomes quite animated.  
- A withdrawn gallus monk (this is Odwald in disguise).  

If anyone approaches Odwald, he will attempt to bluff that he is a humble traveler looking for work defending caravans in order to hone his skills. A character who sits down with Odwald must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to notice a hiccup in his illusion. The moment Odwald feels unsafe, he'll run.

### A Confrontation

Once the party has unmasked Odwald, he won't be able to flee very far. He's tired, ragged from stress, and filled with doubt. If necessary, he will attempt to use the last of his magic to escape. He will refrain from hurting the party and simply look to make a bloodless escape. Odwald will try to turn invisible, or use [suggestion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/suggestion.md) or [fear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fear.md) to attempt to slow down his pursuers or send them off-course. He'll use [counterspell](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/counterspell.md) or [misty step](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/misty-step.md) against any spells cast to restrain him. If he escapes the party, he'll flee Brackenmill and run into the forest. Whatever happens here, the commotion will attract the attention of the local Perch Guard.

Odwald will flee until he reaches a clearing filled with dense and difficult forest terrain. This is the last stop for the exhausted corvum, and once the party has dealt with any ill effects caused by his magic, they should be able to track him here. They'll find him panting, out of energy, and trapped by the difficult terrain. If the party manages to capture him sooner, Odwald will relent once it's clear he cannot escape.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "That's quite enough, I yield," the old corvum wheezes. "I can't run from my fate any longer. Take me away, I'll come quietly..."
^128

Odwald will comply with the party's wishes, letting them place the silver bangles on him, though he will insist on keeping his book of research notes. He intends to go peacefully and cooperate with the Avium, and the notes would make far less sense without his guidance. If questioned, Odwald will explain what he was trying to achieve with his experiments, and why it was so important to him that he be the one to stop the aspect, but that he regrets everything. His actions have brought harm to the Wood and its people. Depending on how much players want to roleplay this, refer to the information presented in Odwald's Fate to further flesh out this interaction.

At some point, the Brackenmill Perch Guard will arrive, drawn by the disturbance caused by Odwald's flight and the party's pursuit. The party can easily explain the situation, and once they present proof that they are working with the Dean of the Avium (their amulets will do) the Perch Guard will relinquish Odwald to their custody. Riffin, who accompanied the guards, looking to help, will rush over to aid his friend, regarding the corvum with a look of shock and confusion.

### Riffin and Odwald

***If Odwald came willingly to Brackenmill,*** the corvum is looking to apologize to Riffin, and this interaction will likely take place in The Sunny Silkworm. Riffin will look more and more confused as Odwald explains himself. Once Odwald has finished his narrative, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The tired old corvum regards his friend with a sad expression. "It's all my fault. Riffin, I'm sorry."
^12a

***If Odwald was trapped in the forest,*** this scene will play out amongst the trees. The strig will look at Odwald and ask him pointedly if what the Defenders of Alderheart said about him is true. Odwald can only look crestfallen, and deliver the above line.

Either way, Riffin is hurt. Odwald not only saved his life, but traveled with him for many years, and Riffin thought he could trust his friend. To find out that the corvum had been keeping so much from him, coupled with the reckless and dangerous nature of his activities, has Riffin considering whether or not to break ties with Odwald.

Riffin will retreat to his room at The Sunny Silkworm without a word. He'll stay here for one more day, but he won't accept any visitors until the next day at dawn. This will give players some time to learn more about him and his motives (see ***If Odwald was apprehended*** under Odwald's Fate, for details into his backstory), all of which might impact their decision whether or not to help repair his friendship with Riffin.

Once Riffin is taking visitors, Odwald will encourage the party to go and convince the string knight to stick around and help their party. The character talking with Riffin can make a Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to convince him to take the course of action they suggest, but the difficulty check of the skill should be modified based on the approach party members take while talking with Riffin. For example, if they appeal to his sense of honor and duty to the Wood, the check should be easier. Some players may decide to have Riffin and Odwald meet to talk things over, which could also be successful. Characters who try to convince Riffin can make any number of arguments:

- They need Riffin's help to defeat the aspect.  
- Riffin should work with them for the good of the Wood.  
- Odwald seems to regret his actions and care deeply about their friendship.  
- Anything else the players might come up with that feels appropriate.  

Decide how things play out based on the motives of the characters, improvising checks with any characters who might be serving to mediate, and select the outcome that best fits with the narrative.

***If Riffin and Odwald reconcile,*** Riffin will steadfastly agree to help the party in whatever way he can on their quest. Riffin and Odwald's relationship will be strained for the rest of the game, but they will work together to defeat the aspect.

Riffin will accompany the party back to the Avium, but he won't have much to say along the way—he's more of a doer than a thinker. Despite recent events, should it be required, he'll act as a character witness for Odwald. Riffin will never totally forgive the old corvum, but he can attest to his brilliance and reliability from their years of adventuring together. Riffin is willing to journey with the party to Alderheart. He'll choose to bunk separately at the Wooden Flagon, the inn and tavern in the trunk district. If the players wish, Riffin can accompany them on the rest of their journey. If he joins the party, he will be treated as another character for the purposes of dividing up XP.

***If Riffin and Odwald don't reconcile,*** Riffin will leave. He feels betrayed, but also conflicted, and he needs time to figure things out. When he returns, it will be in the final battle, after contemplating his duty and coming to the decision to help the party.

***If the party came to Brackenmill to find the escaped Odwald,*** the characters can either return Odwald to the Avium for questioning, or take him to Alderheart, where he will help them find their next lead. This may depend on whether or not the party believes in Odwald's change of heart. Regardless, he'll try to convince them to take him to Alderheart since time is of the essence.

***If the party returns Odwald to the Avium,*** resume play from the *"If Odwald was apprehended"* section in Odwald's Fate.

***If the party killed Odwald,*** they will find the old corvum's book of research notes on his body. Resume play from the *"If Odwald was slain"* section in Odwald's Fate.

***If the party takes Odwald to Alderheart,*** skip to Susan the Seer. The party may need to explain themselves to the Dean or the Council for this later.

### Dean Windsworth

In certain situations, it may be necessary for you to account for the whereabouts of Dean Windsworth during the events of **Part 5**. He can be a pivotal character, filling Odwald's role in the story if Odwald was killed, or an important side character if Odwald lives. The Dean can even assist Odwald in the final battle against the aspect of fire.

***If Odwald lives,*** whether he was apprehended at the Avium (Part 4) or in Brackenmill, the Dean will remain at the College after the party has left for Alderheart. There he will research Odwald's ritual, perhaps improving upon it in the process, until he is ready to rejoin the party for the final fight with the aspect of fire.

***If Odwald is dead,*** the Dean will join up with the party in Alderheart, out of a sense of duty. In all likelihood, the only reason Odwald was able break the aspect's seal in the first place was because of what he learned as a student in the Avium, and the Dean feels that he should make himself available in case the party is in need of advice. The Dean won't help in combat—he will spend his stay in Alderheart looking through the old corvum's notes to decipher the ritual that Odwald theorized would re-seal the aspect.

## Susan the Seer

At this point the party will be led to Alderheart either by the living Odwald, or by information Dean Windsworth gleaned from the deceased corvum's notes. There, Odwald's old friend and former adventuring companion, Susan of the Swamp, can be found. Susan's eclectic scholarship has led to her possessing some esoteric knowledge. This, coupled with her unique divination abilities, means she is the party's best hope of finding *the Borealus*.

### Seeing an Old Friend

The party will find Susan's tent in Alderheart's trunk market (see Return to Alderheart for information on her services). She's been turning a tidy profit in Alderheart with her fortune telling. If the party has encountered her before this, she'll greet them fondly and tell them she's been meaning to pack up and head back to her hut in the swamp to try out some new experimental conjury. Perhaps it's fate that they came here when they did.

***If Odwald is with the party,*** she'll give him a warm welcome and ask how he's been all this time. While Odwald is happy to see Susan, he'll make it clear that catching up will need to wait, explaining the urgency of their task.

***If Odwald was killed,*** this is explained to Susan. She will become quiet and solemnly agree to help the players with any task they should need for the good of the Wood.

However this encounter happens, Susan will eventually perform her ritual.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The hedge witch circles her snail shell cauldron, picking handfuls of hanging herbs and small dessicated creatures from around her tent, and plopping them into the brew. Her beetle familiar, Normal, assists in this task, and as it drops a shriveled tentacle into the cauldron, Susan chuckles, "Starfish, for visions as clear as a midsummer's night..." The witch mutters an incantation over the brew, and then, satisfied with her work, she grabs a ladle and portions out a bit of the liquid, blowing it cool before taking a sip.
^12e

As soon as Susan sips the concoction, her pupils dilate until her eyes turn black. They appear to contain stars and constellations, and for a moment Susan seems far away. Then her eyes return to normal, and Susan regains her senses.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "What a vision... there are so many possible futures, it's hard to keep track!" she says, moving to a small bookshelf behind her. "I saw one great power being kept in check by another. An endless dance of fire and ice." Susan then pulls a tome from the shelf and rifles through it. "*the Borealus* wants to be united with the flames. It is barred behind a door of cinders, to which only the Tenders have the key. To reach it you must find... this!"
^12f

Susan will find the page she was looking for, and show it to the party. It's an illustration of a plant that characters proficient in the [Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival) or [Nature](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature) skills can easily recognize as skyleaf, a type of leafy vine that grows around the taller trees in Humblewood. She'll explain her vision showed a sprig of skyleaf would be the key to accessing *the Borealus*, and that the artifact still rests in Humblewood, but beyond this she isn't sure. Signs pointed to the Tenders living in Alderheart; a character the party should be familiar with holds the second key to *the Borealus'* resting place.

Susan will tell the party that skyleaf vines grow in a part of the forest to the northwest, a three hour walk from Alderheart. The party can choose to search for the skyleaf right away (see Picking through the Ashes), or speak to the Tenders (see The Wisdom of Tenders). Remind the players they can also avail themselves of Alderheart's many shops while they're here, including Eliza's Emporium.

### Picking through the Ashes

The northwest forests of Alderheart have changed.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You arrive to see a sparse, burned forest. Ashes litter the branches and cover the forest floor in a thick carpet. To the north, a swath of charred trees is visible in the distance, unmistakably the work of the aspect. It looks like the aspect has been able to push even closer to Alderheart.
^131

The ashes that cover the forest floor are cool, and possess none of the supernatural properties that ashes within the Scorched Grove have, but their presence here is disconcerting. The forest is still, and the familiar sights and sounds of the Wood are conspicuously absent.

A party member will need to make a DC 16 Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) or Intelligence ([Nature](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check to locate skyleaf among the ash-covered foliage. This search can be done either from the ground or in a tree, but once the leaf is located, a character will need to climb up to retrieve it. Any character attempting to climb a tree must make a DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, as skyleaf grows only within the highest branches. After a character has acquired the skyleaf sprig, (preferably while one or more party members are up in a tree) the party will run into an [ashsnake](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/ashsnake-hwcs.md) that will try to use the ash cover to ambush a target close enough to the ground. Resolve passive perception checks as normal, and point out that the trees in this part of the forest are in small copses around 80 feet apart, making it difficult (but not impossible) to retreat using glide.

### The Wisdom of Tenders

The Tenders the party will find in Alderheart are [Tevor of the Spring Path](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tevor-of-the-spring-path-hwcs.md) and [Havel of the Autumn Moon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/havel-of-the-autumn-moon-hwcs.md), whom they met in Part 3: An Urgent Summons. The party should run into Havel and Tevor at the Tenders' headquarters within Alderheart's trunk. If the players aren't familiar with this location yet, it won't be hard to locate when asking around. Despite the short supply of Tenders in the Wood, both Havel and Tevor (presuming Tevor survived the events of **Part 3**) can be found there, helping where needed.

If Tevor is still alive, Havel and Tevor have begun to live together, and are clearly affectionate toward one another. The harrowing events in the Wood lately have helped deepen their bond, and they now work as partners to train and coordinate the less experienced Tenders. If Tevor died, Havel carries on alone, working hard to honor Tevor's sacrifice.

Either way, whoever is there to meet the party greets them warmly, and will offer up any assistance the Defenders of Alderheart require.

Havel is familiar with old Tender legends about *the Borealus*. He explains:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "The story of *the Borealus* tells of a wizard who stole a piece of a powerful spirit of winter. They thought they could control its icy power by containing it within a staff, but instead it froze them. Left to itself, the newly-made artifact kept freezing the land around it. The tales say that the old Tenders felt this imbalance in the Wood. When they found *the Borealus*, they had the artifact sealed away by Tender Elders using a sprig of skyleaf, which remains hearty even through the winter."
^133

Havel will add that he hadn't placed much stock in the tale, since it's ancient, and he only came across it after a long period of study. When he first read it, he thought the story to be a parable about the dangers of trying to enslave the powers of living elementals. When the party (or Odwald, if he's traveling with them) tells Havel what they know, he'll be surprised and offer to help the Defenders of Alderheart however he can.

***If Tevor is alive,*** he will reveal some practical information that can help locate *the Borealus*. Tevor will recall a story he once heard from his mentor. According to the tale, the fate of an elder who wished to become a Tender Treekeeper was decided by delivering an unburned skyleaf sprig to a frog-shaped rock in the southwest of the Scorched Grove. Havel will support Tevor, and say he believes this agrees with references to an ancient chamber in the Scorched Grove. The text appeared in the historical records around the same time as the stories of *the Borealus* being sealed away. Neither Tevor nor Havel can take the party to the location because they're needed in Alderheart, but Tevor can mark it on the party's map. It's a fairly distinctive landmark, so the party should be able to find it easily with this direction.

***If Tevor is dead,*** Havel will admit he doesn't know anything that might hint at the Borealus' location, but he has access to some rather old tomes of lore in the archives of the Tenders' headquarters. If given time to unravel this mystery, Havel might be able to find something of use. It will take him a day to discover the information, which he will be so eager to deliver to the party that he'll rush to meet them at dawn wherever they're staying. He will say, tearfully, that he recalled a story Tevor once told him, and he just needed to look up references in the ancient records to be sure. Havel will tell the party that the entrance to *the Borealus'* resting place is in the Scorched Grove, near a frog-shaped rock in the south.

## The Crucible of Fire

Odwald will ask to accompany the party into the Scorched Grove, but he'll point out that due to his magical restraints he won't be of use to them in a fight. Should any party members try to get crafty and break Odwald out of the silver bangles, a close examination will reveal that the restraints cannot be dispelled or removed through conventional means, and appear to be made of a virtually indestructible material. If another reason to prevent Odwald from fighting by the party's side is required, he can also point out that should he die, the knowledge of the ritual which might save the Wood dies with him.

While he'll do his best to stay out of combat, Odwald can offer valuable insights. The party makes Intelligence checks with advantage while Odwald is with them. Should the heroes decide to journey without him, Odwald will stay in Alderheart under Perch Guard supervision, and await the party's return.

It's also possible that the party could bring Riffin along for this journey. Be sure to adjust encounters appropriately if this is the case.

The party can reach the Grove in a day's travel if they don't mind hiking through the more dangerous parts of the Wood. Much of the Wood is covered in ash, and the energies of the Grove have spread in such a way that small patches of the nearby forested areas have become home to creatures and phenomena previously only witnessed in the Grove. For a more action-filled trip, roll on the [Scorched Grove Encounters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/appendix-e-random-encounters-scorched-grove-encounters-level-3-hwcs.md) table. Optionally, skip right to the next section to increase the pace of the game.

In stark contrast to their last trip through the Scorched Grove, the party will find the ashen plain to be eerily silent and devoid of life, even the strange variety that usually finds purchase here. This is due to the increasing influence of the aspect of fire, which has caused the creatures here to scatter. It is much hotter and drier than it was before; have characters make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw once as part of traveling through the Grove, taking a level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) from the heat on a failure.

### Buried in the Ash

In order to contain the tremendous ice-aspected energies of *the Borealus*, the Tenders created a dungeon hidden beneath ash, and several magical defenses to keep the artifact out of mortal hands. The Elder Tenders of old needed to store the staff where the fire-aspected energies of the Scorched Grove could serve to keep *the Borealus'* dangerous energies sequestered. In times long past, Tenders wishing to join the leadership of their organization would come here to be tested for their worthiness; this practice was ended when a breach of the sanctum caused the Tenders to swear the location of *the Borealus* to secrecy and destroy records of its location. Only scant myths and snippets of information escaped the culling. Eventually, the last of those who possessed actual knowledge of the artifact died, and the dungeon has sat unused for hundreds of years.

*The Borealus* lies at the lowest level of the dungeon, where the flame energies are strongest. It is safeguarded by an ancient treant called [Oakheart](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/oakheart-hwcs.md). He is a sworn guardian, who was given instructions to only allow *the Borealus* to pass into the hands of one who understands and is committed to keeping nature's balance.

The party should arrive at the frog-shaped rock after a few hours of travel through the Grove, but they need to figure out how to locate the dungeon's entrance. Without the proper key, the entrance to the dungeon will not reveal itself. Read the following if the party is carrying the sprig of skyleaf with them:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As soon as you and your companions arrive at the frog-shaped rock formation, the ground begins to quake. Five pedestals emerge from the ashes, one at each cardinal point around a flat disk that rises in their center. The fifth stands in the middle of the disk. One of the four outer pedestals is broken.
^136

The pedestals rise from the earth, to a height of four feet. The ones to the west, east, and south have distinctive carvings and motifs, along with a domed receptacle on their top which opens like a mouth. The receptacles are large enough to fit the sprig of skyleaf. The fourth pedestal to the north is broken in half and exhibits obvious wear, as though it had been smashed long ago. The pedestal in the center of the disk has no domed receptacle or motif carved, only an inscribed Druidic rhyme. Druidic is a language known only by druids, but any character using the [comprehend languages](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/comprehend-languages.md) spell or a similar effect will be able to read this:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The cycle of nature is death and rebirth,  
> forests to ashes and ashes to earth.  
> Stand in the compass and your proof there deliver,  
> to the cleanser of forests, the sapling's life-giver.  
^137

The motifs carved into the three intact pedestals represent elemental forces of nature. The one to the west has motifs of waves and rain clouds, the one to the east has gusting winds and blowing leaves, and the one to the south has flames and smoke plumes. Upon closer examination, the broken pedestal has worn geometric motifs, depicting fallen trees on fractured ground, most likely representing earth. At least one party member must stand in the middle of these pedestals when placing the skyleaf sprig into a receptacle. Whether or not the party chooses the correct answer, nothing will happen if no one is standing in the center of the "compass" when placing the sprig inside a receptacle.

The correct answer is to set the sprig in the receptacle of the pedestal with the flame motifs. This will cause the sprig to ignite with magical flames and the pedestals to recede, revealing the door to the dungeon.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The ashen field shifts again as the pillars recede beneath it. Then, with a lurch, a small hill rises from the ashes. A square section on the front of this hill falls away, revealing an open door. Ancient stone steps descend into darkness.
^138

The steps lead to the room in The Guardians of Flame.

The other two answers are incorrect.

***If the sprig is placed in the receptacle of the pedestal with the water motif,*** party members in the center of the compass will be caught in a trap, as the disk between the pillars instantly transforms into a 15-foot-diameter pool of cold water. The water within the pool is very deep, and moves as if possessed by a will of its own. Characters inside of the pool can feel a strong force attempting to pull them down into the cold depths and hold them there.

Have the players roll initiative. At the top of each round, each character in the pool takes 3 (`1d6`) points of cold damage and must make a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to avoid being pulled under. Characters who are pulled under are [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded) by the dark waters, and may suffocate unless they can breathe water or hold their breath. Remember that characters can hold their breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + their Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds or 5 rounds), after which point they begin to suffocate.

Any player can use their action to attempt the [Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics) check again on their turn. A character that has been pulled under can succeed on this check to reach the surface, allowing them to gasp for air. A character that is not currently being held under the water can attempt the [Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics) check again on their turn to pull themselves free of the pool, though doing so is sufficiently taxing, and a character who successfully escapes the trap can do nothing else this turn.

Any character outside of the pool can make a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to free someone inside the pool. A character who has been pulled under the water is out of reach to a character outside of the pool, but characters in the pool who have not been can assist those who have been pulled under. Players may think of clever strategies to help their friends out, like throwing ropes and the like, but the water is dark in addition to being bitterly cold, and any character that was pulled under makes Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks with disadvantage.

Once all characters have left the pool, the disk returns to normal and the sprig may be safely retrieved from the water pedestal.

***If the sprig is placed in the receptacle of the pedestal with the wind motif,*** party members in the center of the compass will be caught in a trap, as a 15-foot-sphere of wind appears above the disk between the pillars. The sphere encloses all creatures standing on the disk, lifting them 10 feet into the air, and begins to slowly crush them.

Have the players roll initiative. At the top of each round, each character in the sphere takes 4 (`1d8`) points of bludgeoning damage from the buffeting winds and must make a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to avoid being [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the gusting force.

A character that has been [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) can use their action to attempt this check again. On a success, the character is no longer grappled. A character that is not currently grappled can attempt the DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check again on their turn to push their way out of the wind sphere, falling [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space outside of the compass.

Any character outside of the sphere can make this check to free someone trapped inside on a success. However, a character outside who enters the sphere's space must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be sucked inside as well. Characters inside the sphere who try to free a grappled ally roll their Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check with disadvantage.

Players may think of clever strategies to help their friends out. Using a staff or a 10-foot pole a character can attempt to free a trapped ally without the risk of being sucked in themselves. Using a spell like [thunderwave](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/thunderwave.md) to blast allies clear of the effect will also work. Any thrown ropes or projectiles will simply be blown aside by the force of the sphere's winds.

Once all characters are free of the sphere, it slowly dissipates and the sprig may be safely retrieved from the wind pedestal.

### The Guardians of Flame

The stairway descends into the dungeon for about 150 feet, occasionally turning and twisting upon itself, until it opens into a round chamber with a circular entranceway. There is no light source down here, and players without [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) will need to provide illumination for themselves.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You see a chamber that appears to have been shaped out of black, volcanic rock. There is a wooden disk in the center of this chamber that has a series of druidic runes carved into its surface. In one quadrant of the disk these runes glow dimly with red light. Four alcoves surround this central room, equidistant from each other. In three of them, large statues of eagles, made from the same volcanic rock, rest upon intricately shaped branches of small, petrified trees. The fourth alcove is empty.
^13a

This chamber is 60 feet across, and each alcove is 10 feet across. The wooden disk in the center of the room is immune to fire damage, as are the petrified trees upon which the statues rest. As soon as the entire party enters the room, a stone slab closes over circular entryway, trapping the party inside. Each statue comes alight as the rock from which it is composed turns to barely-cooled magma. The 3 statues are Medium creatures that use the stat block for [gargoyles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md), with the following changes:

- They speak Ignan instead of Terran.  
- They are resistant to fire damage, but nothing else.  
- They attack with their claws and their beaks, which use the same stats for the claw and bite attacks of the gargoyles. These attacks deal fire damage instead of slashing or piercing damage.  

When an eagle statue is defeated it transforms into red flames, which are drawn toward the druidic runes on the wooden disk in the room's center. This will cause a section of the central platform's runes to glow red. Once the statues have been defeated, all of the runes will be lit, and the platform can be used to travel between this room and the dungeon's lower level. Stepping onto the activated platform, a character will learn that the code words "ascend" and "descend" can be spoken anywhere in this dungeon to cause this platform to magically float down to the lower levels, or rise back up to this chamber.

### The Blazing Barriers

Speaking the word "descend," the platform moves down a 50-foot shaft, which opens into a wide subterranean cavern, and lands in a disk-shaped depression on an island.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This large subterranean cavern is lit by the glow of magma, which flows below an island of rock. A long bridge connects the island to a bank on the other side, where a passageway continues through the cavern wall. It is sweltering in here.
^13c

The island is a mere 30 feet wide, and the ceilings are 60 feet high. The magma lies 60 feet below the island of rock, and any character that gets too near the edges of the island will feel its full heat. The heat isn't enough to cause damage, but any creature that falls into the magma will almost certainly die, if they're not immune to fire damage, taking 33 (`6d10`) points of fire damage each time they enter magma for the first time on a turn, or end their turn there. Fortunately, under normal circumstances there are no dangers within this place that would cause a character to fall into the magma. Add such hazards if desired, but consider the risks carefully.

The bridge over the magma is 10 feet wide and 20 feet long. It appears to have small gaps at 5-foot intervals. Any player who steps onto the bridge's surface will trigger the bridge's main trap, which will cause a 20-foot-high jet of flame to erupt from the nearest gap. This jet remains for a few seconds, receding for a moment before flaring up again.

The party can tell that these flame jets aren't made of magma, but that they are still dangerous. Any character who passes through one will need to succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check to avoid taking damage. Failure on this check means the character must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, or take 10 (`3d6`) points of fire damage from the flames on a failure, or half as much on a success. Whether or not they succeed on this save, the characters will arrive on the other side of the jet, which will trigger the next flame jet.

Characters who hesitate once they begin crossing will find their energy sapped, as they are caught between the hot jets. It is impossible for a character to run across the bridge avoiding these jets, unless they succeed on the listed [Acrobatics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics) check for every jet they cross.

There are a few ways to circumvent this obstacle:

- Players might have access to the [fly](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fly.md) spell, which can be used to avoid the bridge altogether.  
- Players with resistance to fire may be able to make it across even if they cannot succeed on their checks, especially if they have the ability to heal themselves.  
- Players can attempt to block the jets of flame, though the jets erupt with enough force to blast through wooden barriers. If a metal object (like a shield) is held in place to allow passage across a jet, it will be rendered red hot, causing 9 (`2d8`) points of fire damage to anyone holding or stepping onto the object.  
- The [Tenser's floating disk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tensers-floating-disk.md) spell will completely block the flame jets, and its magic will shield anyone on top of the disk from the heat of the jets, allowing for easy passage.  

Use the above rules to decide whether any of the more unique solutions players could conceive of will work.

On the bank at the other side of the bridge is a lever disguised as a rock formation. Any character with a passive perception of 17 or higher, or who succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, will be able to notice the lever. When pulled, the lever causes the flame jets to cease, and the magma in the chamber to cool almost instantly into solid rock. The tunnel into the rock wall ahead is the only way forward.

### Oakheart the Guardian

The passageway from the magma chamber continues for another 400 feet, curving downwards until it leads into a strange space.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The tunnel transitions into a room that has been magically shaped from the earth beneath the Grove. The floor is made of black cobblestones, shaped from a layer of volcanic rock. Breaking through the stones is a line of three great trees. Each tree appears black and charred, with leaves of flame and bark that glows like embers. The tree in the middle is the largest, and its roots tangle outward in a great mass.
^13e

The room is 90 feet long and 60 feet wide. The largest tree is [Oakheart](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/oakheart-hwcs.md). Once enough of the party has made it within 80 feet of the trees, Oakheart will reveal himself, shuddering as if waking from a deep slumber. His body shifts into a more humanoid form. Oakheart speaks slowly in Birdfolk, or in Druidic if one of the party members is a druid, with a voice that sounds like a cross between creaking wood and a blasting forge.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Suddenly, the great tree at the back of the room quivers, and its bark shifts to reveal eyes and a mouth. Its long branches twist into hands and its roots become large feet. "Hrrmmmmmm... so... I am to receive... guests? How long has it been?" the creature creaks. "You do not look... like Tenders... a test is in order then..."
^13f

Oakheart will then fight the party to test whether or not they possess the skill needed to safely control *the Borealus*. If the above dialog was interrupted by a player launching an attack at any point, do not treat Oakheart as being surprised and simply roll initiative as normal. Oakheart is sworn to guard *the Borealus* from thieves, and if attacked while speaking he'll scold the players on his turn, saying:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Little ones... so impatient..."
^140

If the party attempts to talk their way out of this fight, he will say:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "It matters not... None may obtain *the Borealus*... until they have proven... their worth!" 
^141

Oakheart will begin by animating the other two charred trees in the room. They have stats identical to Oakheart, but otherwise follow the rules for animated trees in the [treant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant.md) stat block.

Oakheart will not die once he reaches 0 hit points, but he will cease his assault and return the trees he animated to their posts. He is a guardian, but unless the party shows or has shown signs of ill intent throughout the dungeon, he will sense that they are not thieves and try not to kill them. He simply wishes to test whether or not they are strong enough to control the terrible power of *the Borealus*.

If the party does poorly in this fight, Oakheart may cease his assault and dismiss his animated trees, sitting down to parley. He'll ask why they have risked their lives to obtain *the Borealus*. If Oakheart is satisfied with the answer (attempting to save the Wood from burning is an acceptable explanation), he will give them the staff.

Whether defeated in battle or convinced to give the players *the Borealus*, Oakheart will inform the party that he has safe-guarded the artifact with his own life force, and for its power to become unsealed his life must end. There's no way around this. If characters sympathize, he will thank them for their concerns, and offer a warm smile before delivering the parting statement:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I have lived for a very... very... very long time. I go... with the blessing of the Nightfather... that I may pass onto you... this burden." Oakheart then reaches into a hollow in his trunk, and pulls out a luminous crystal staff. "Plant this one in flames... such is its power... otherwise... the Wood may freeze..."
^142

As Oakheart speaks the light from his bark dims, and his flame-leaves fade, leaving behind a large blackened tree amidst the chamber.

> [!note] Treasure
> 
> The party receives the artifact they came here for: [the Borealus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/borealus-hwcs.md).
^treasure

Once the party has acquired *the Borealus*, have them return to Alderheart.

## The Final Summons

Upon returning to Alderheart, give the party a chance to have a long rest and recover from any exhaustion they may have suffered traveling through the Grove. After resting, they will find Dean Windsworth waiting for them in the common room of the inn in which they are staying. He has been called on by the Council to advise the Defenders of Alderheart during these perilous times. The Dean will be stupefied by the existence of *the Borealus*, and overjoyed that the party has obtained it. This means there is a chance to stop the aspect and save the Wood.

If Odwald is with the party, he will explain that the aspect must still be weakened in order for *the Borealus* to be useful in sealing it. What's more, in order to channel a power as vast as *the Borealus* is said to contain, the ritual requires at least two mages working in tandem to succeed. This ritual must be done over the conjuration circle that was used to seal the aspect the first time. Fortunately for them, Odwald knows its location. If Odwald died, the Dean will take over Odwald's role in explaining the information gleaned from the necromancer's ritual notes.

After learning about the ritual, the party will notice a commotion outside the inn. Some people are closing up their shops, others appear to be filing to the city gates with hastily packed bags, some with families in tow, and others still are heading toward the canopy. The party will soon learn the cause, either by asking passersby or listening to town criers, who announce an emergency meeting of all citizenry. The party can investigate, but it won't be long before they receive a summons from the Council. The news is grim: the aspect is moving toward the Great Tree City.

Everyone is crowded around the Council Chambers, some literally hanging from branches and filling up every inch of available space. In this sea of faces, the party will see any currently living friendly NPC they might have encountered on their journey who would reasonably be in Alderheart at this time, including: the Dean, Benna, Riffin, Susan, Odwald, Havel, Tevor, Eliza, and the jerbeen orphans.

The citizens are nervous and whispering amongst themselves. Some say they saw an intense red-orange glow far off in the forest, others that Alderheart is under attack, and some are worried the Council will call for an evacuation.

A contingent of The Spears escorts the members of the Council (including, if appropriate, any newly-elected humblefolk delegates) onto a specially prepared platform with a row of seats and a podium that bears Alderheart's city crest. [Bita, the Council Speaker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/bita-the-council-speaker-hwcs.md) appears from out of the ranks of the Council members as they take their seats. A hush falls over the crowd when she approaches the podium:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "My fellow citizens, we have just received a dire report from our watchposts. The elemental creature that so recently arose from beneath our Wood now makes its way toward Alderheart."
^145

The citizens may remain silent, or begin to despair. They might even start to panic, at which point the Defenders of Alderheart may step in to help regain control. As symbols of hope in the realm, the crowd will listen to them. Any party member can step up to make a reassuring statement and attempt a DC 16 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to calm the populace, allowing Speaker Bita to continue. Have a character roll this check with advantage if their reputation has earned them particular favor among the many Alderites (if they are seen as a champion of the people, for example).

Speaker Bita gives the crowd a moment, thanking the Defenders of Alderheart if they provided assistance, then resumes, speaking with a grace and dignity that inspires hope even in these dark times:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Recently, we have faced many hardships. The flames that ravaged the Wood have threatened to tear our communities apart. Yet, Alderheart still stands. We are not birdfolk and humblefolk, nor are we perch-dwellers and forest-dwellers: we are people of Humblewood. Since its creation, Alderheart was meant to stand as a symbol of our unity. Perhaps we have lost our way since those early days, but there is still a chance for a brighter future. However, in order to obtain it we must stand together now! I implore each and every citizen of Humblewood, not as the Council Speaker, but as a fellow resident of the Wood. We must defend each other, we must defend Humblewood. It is the only home we have."
^146

Someone starts cheering. Whoever starts the cheer is optional: it may be a humblefolk (perhaps one of the jerbeen orphans, or a reformed bandit working for the Wildwood Brigade), or a birdfolk (maybe Tevor, showing his newfound courage, or Riffin, to inspire the people). This one cry will multiply, and soon the crowd cheers together with one voice, as denizens from all parts of Humblewood unite.

### Preparing for Battle

After Speaker Bita's speech, the party will be found by either Odwald or the Dean (if Odwald isn't alive) and told that, by the looks of it, the aspect's influence in this region has grown tenfold since the party's first encounter. If they don't take the opportunity to try and seal the aspect with *the Borealus* now, even if it is driven back, the aspect may become too strong to attempt sealing again.

The Defenders of Alderheart will soon find their presence requested by the Council: the aspect of fire must be stopped before it reaches the Great Tree City. Its movement has stirred up ashsnakes, emberbats, and other fire creatures that are causing havoc in the surrounding forest. Give the party a chance to explain to the Council what they can do to help (the Council is receptive to most ideas), but if the party doesn't mention sealing away the aspect, then either Odwald or the Dean (if Odwald is dead) will make the suggestion.

While the Council will listen to the Dean, Odwald will be looked upon more suspiciously, and the party may need to convince the members on his behalf. To keep the tension high maybe have the party roll Charisma checks for this. The Council will trust the Defenders of Alderheart, even if they don't trust Odwald. However the Council is convinced, Speaker Bita will make it clear in no uncertain terms that the fate of the Wood is in the party's hands.

Odwald will elaborate that in order to complete the ritual to seal the aspect, two mages must work together to weave a spell into the existing conjuration circle to strengthen and alter its magic. He'll also remind the party of the importance of utilizing cold-type magics to subdue the aspect. Once it has been subdued, they will have only an hour before it regenerates, so it's imperative that the character attuned to *the Borealus* brings it to the circle, so the mages can complete the sealing.

If a spellcasting party member volunteers to help the NPCs prepare the sealing ritual, they will be turned down. Preparing the ritual will be time-consuming and require such focus that the party member wouldn't be able to fight the aspect at the same time. The mages who work the ritual need to rely on the Defenders of Alderheart to ensure their efforts aren't interrupted. Odwald (or the Dean, if Odwald is dead) will explain that the second mage must have a good grasp of arcane theory and precise control over their magic. They will essentially serve as an additional power source and they therefore do not need to have the same familiarity with the ritual.

Odwald can think of only one other spellcaster he would trust with this ritual: Susan, and he will ask for her to accompany him (if she is alive). Otherwise, the Dean can help. The Dean has a strong desire to see this through to the end, and would gladly work with Odwald for the good of the Wood. If Odwald is dead, the Dean will need assistance for the ritual. Should Susan not be able to assist, a Council member will mention knowing of a talented spellcasting protégé within the Tenders who may be able to help. This is, of course, Havel.

If Odwald is conducting the ritual he will request to have the restraints inhibiting his magic removed, which will cause the Council consternation, but they will ultimately agree.

If the party is still suspicious of Odwald's intentions and unwilling to have his restraints removed, the Dean (who has been looking through Odwald's notes) is familiar enough with the material to lead the ritual. Even so, he'll insist they bring Odwald along, shackled or not, as the corvum's knowledge could prove useful should something go awry.

The plan is to have the mages escorted to the conjuration circle, by either the Wildwood Brigade or the Perch Guard, to prepare the ritual. The rest of the Perch Guard and/or Wildwood Brigade will need to work together to keep the path to the aspect cleared for the party.

Whoever is leading the ritual indicates that someone will have to grab the aspect's attention and lure it closer to the Grove. If the aspect is too far away when the ritual is completed, there's no guarantee it will be sealed. Scouts report that the aspect is easy to provoke, but it'll be difficult to outpace, and luring it to the Grove will certainly place the volunteer in incredible danger. Riffin volunteers to help draw the aspect back to the circle if he's here, otherwise a Defender of Alderheart has to volunteer for the task. Speed won't matter as much as endurance, since they'll need to be able to withstand whatever the aspect can throw at them in order to make it to the Grove.

As the party leaves the Council chambers, they will witness something special:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The mood in the city is electric. Birdfolk and humblefolk from all walks of life work hand-in-hand, with the Perch Guard distributing weapons and armor to any who volunteer. Those who cannot fight are readying supply lines and bucket brigades to help people on the front lines combat forest fires and support the Defenders of Alderheart. Everyone in Alderheart is doing their best to pitch in however they can.
^148

If any characters are looking to prepare for the final fight, the party has a small window to resupply. Many of Alderheart's shops have been closed or abandoned, but the armories of Alderheart are open to the party, allowing them to take whatever supplies they may need (Weapons, Armor, or Adventuring Gear). If they're looking for a little extra, Eliza's Emporium is always open, though even in such dire times the party won't be able to get a magic item for free. Eliza is volunteering for the bucket brigade and plans on living through this. While she's still willing to offer "friends-only" prices, and supply the party with any non-magical necessities they might need to complete their mission, she has no intention of giving up her livelihood out of fear.

## The Chase

Before the characters can do battle with the aspect of fire, they must find a way to lure it out of the forest toward the Scorched Grove. This is necessary not only for the ritual, but because the abundance of available fuel in the forest makes the aspect functionally invincible there. Consider having a scout report that the aspect seems to flare up as it burns through the forest, as players may be unaware that the aspect can heal itself using the trees it consumes. While not a vital clue at this stage, this information about the aspect is essential to the fight. If not given the hint, players will have to deduce why the aspect is not weakening when fought in wooded areas.

If Riffin volunteered to lure the aspect of fire into the Grove, skip to Facing the Aspect.

If Riffin wasn't around to volunteer, the player character who volunteered to bait the aspect will accompany a unit of Perch Guard or Wildwood Brigade scouts into the part of the forest where the aspect is advancing. In the meantime, the rest of the party and the mages will be escorted to the conjuration circle to ready for the aspect's arrival. It isn't necessary for more than one party member to serve as bait, and if multiple characters volunteer then either Odwald or the Dean will advise against it, insisting that the rest of the party will need their strength to fight the aspect.

Separated from their friends, read to the player that volunteered:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Around you, you can see woodland denizens of all kinds fighting. Parts of the forest are ablaze. Bucket brigades desperately try to keep the fires in check while coordinated teams assault massive ashsnakes and use specially-crafted nets to drive back swarms of emberbats. The scouts lead you further into the brush, until you can see the blazing form of the aspect lumbering toward Alderheart. It hasn't yet spotted you or your guides in your hiding place.
^14a

The aspect of fire will give chase as soon as it sees the volunteer character, hurling hunks of magma at the lone hero. Rather than resolving this engagement using movement speed, resolve the chase through the ash covered-forest by having the pursued character make a DC 18 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) or Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to keep ahead of the aspect and avoid taking damage. On a failure, have the player make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (`4d10`) fire damage on a failure, and half as much on a success. The character being chased can take one other action in addition to making their check, but they can do nothing else since the rest of their energies are focused on the flight.

If a player decides to attack the aspect during this chase, resolve their attack as normal, but the aspect won't take any damage. The character should see that once the aspect moves through a stand of trees, its fire consumes the trees, causing it to regain health and blaze brightly.

The character being chased must succeed on four of the above [Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics) checks to lure the aspect toward the conjuration circle. Resolve each failure as it happens. Once the character being chased succeeds on two Dexterity or Strength checks, or is doing poorly, Riffin will appear, shielding the character from a hit and preventing the damage. From this point on, Riffin will protect the character from further harm.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As the fireball hurtles toward you, you see a flash of steel and suddenly find yourself shielded from the blast. Looking over, you can see Riffin, running alongside you with his shield held high. The face of his shield emits a barrier of wind which deflects the aspect's flames. The small strig gives you a smile and shouts, "Sorry I didn't help sooner, but I'm not about to let the whole Wood burn! Riffin the Ash-Knight, at your service."
^14b

However he feels about Odwald, Riffin has decided that his duty, both to the Wood and as a knight, comes first. This is the right thing to do.

> [!note] Riffin's Fate
> 
> Depending on who is alive, and if Riffin isn't alive, have another NPC be the last-minute-hero.
> 
> Or, should this be the first time the characters talk to Riffin, some introductions will be in order.

## Facing the Aspect

![[z_Assets/b890b46155d77fc851645bea7f1fd900_MD5.webp]]

Refer to Fig. 5.1 for a map of the Final Battle with the Aspect.

The final battle with the [aspect of fire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/aspect-of-fire-hwcs.md) will take place in a 120-foot by 80-foot field that is mostly ashen plains. To the south of the field is 40-feet-deep tree cover. The aspect will be led through a gap in the tree cover that is 20 feet wide.

Only the 40 feet of tree cover to the south is substantial enough for the aspect to heal using its "Fuel for the Fire" ability.

The conjuration circle is 20 feet in diameter, and it's located 40 feet from the tree cover and 80 feet from the eastern edge of the map. As long as the aspect remains on the map, it is near enough to the circle for the ritual to succeed.

The aspect of fire gains the following ability:

- ***Rekindle.*** If the aspect of fire is at 0 hit points, it regains 10 hit points at the start of its next turn. If the aspect is reduced to 0 hit points by cold damage, or is hit with cold damage while at 0 hit points, rekindle doesn't function at the start of the aspect's next turn and the aspect becomes petrified. The aspect is petrified only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't rekindle. The aspect can not rekindle for one hour after being petrified. After an hour of being petrified, the aspect will regain all of its hit points and no longer be petrified.   

> [!note] A Million Little Pieces
> 
> No matter how many pieces of the aspect are broken off while petrified, the aspect will reform. In `1d4` rounds, it will become whole again. Once petrification wears off, treat each separate piece as having the aspect's molten skin ability. 
^a-million-little-pieces

![[z_Assets/531604066701962e1dbbfdd432226191_MD5.webp]]

> [!gallery]
> ![[z_Assets/cec16e9e947f7492a76944262c0b7d77_MD5.webp]]

First, what happens here will be decided by whomever was luring the aspect. If it was Riffin, read this:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The ground begins to quake, softly at first, then heavier and more rhythmic, until Riffin can be seen dashing hurriedly through the treeline toward the party. A moment later, the trees erupt in flames as the aspect bursts through the forest, leaving cinders in its wake. It seems to recognize you, and bellows in fury as it advances.
^14f

If a character lured the aspect have them arrive along with Riffin, and with the aspect in tow. Give the injured character a chance to be healed. An NPC will act at the top of the round by rushing over and casting a [cure wounds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cure-wounds.md) spell at 3rd level on the injured character (assume a Wisdom modifier of +3 for the spell) before retreating. The NPC can either be Tevor (if he's alive), Havel (if not performing the ritual), or another NPC Tender.

Riffin will retreat, as the chase has exhausted him. While he longs to fight, he feels he would be more of a burden to them in his fatigued state, and insists they go on without him.

The task of facing the aspect of fire is up to the Defenders of Alderheart now.

At least one party member must attack the aspect each turn to hold its attention, otherwise the mages are at risk. If the party successfully keeps the aspect's attention, it will fight recklessly, ignoring everyone but the party.

If the aspect tries to attack the mages, the mages can spare some of the ritual power to create a shield against the aspect's attacks, causing the mages to take no damage from any attacks for one round. This will only work three times before they can no longer defend themselves.

If the aspect drops to half its hit points or lower, it will move as quickly as it can toward the treeline to try and refuel using the timber.

The battle ends once the aspect is petrified, at which point the mages will call to the character holding *the Borealus* and instruct them on what to do.

### Healing the Wood

With the aspect cooled or temporarily dissipated, the party has only one hour to complete the ritual before the creature returns to full strength. The two mages standing over the conjuration circle beckon to the character attuned with *the Borealus* to stand in the ritual circle's center.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The heat which surrounds you inside the circle is intense, but it feels as though *the Borealus* is pushing back against it. You feel the opposing elemental forces grate against each other as you reach the circle's center.
^151

Upon reaching the center, either Odwald or Dean Windsworth will give the signal to plant the staff into the earth. The moment *the Borealus* hits the ground, a stream of energy shoots out and surrounds the petrified aspect. Once enveloped, the aspect begins to lose its physical form, becoming one with the energy around it. Suddenly, the flow of energy is pulled back into the ritual circle. Immediately, the heat will dissipate and a wave of pressure will emanate from the circle, knocking anyone within 500 feet who is not inside of the circle [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).

For a moment there is calm, but during this time the mages still struggle. The energies that crackle from their hands feed into the circle, which once again begins to flare. The ritual has been enacted, but something is wrong. There isn't enough power. *The Borealus'* long confinement has left it too weak to provide the required energy. Reaching the required level of power can only be done at a cost: someone will need to give their life in order to complete the ritual.

***If Odwald is alive,*** any party member with the ability to cast spells, or the party member attuned to *the Borealus*, can volunteer. However, even if they do Odwald will insist upon being the one to give up his life. It was his mistakes that got the Wood into this mess, so in his eyes it's only fair that he forfeit his life. There is no time to argue, and if another character volunteers and refuses to back down, Odwald will appear to acquiesce, only to sacrifice himself at the last minute and save them. As the blaze of the ritual fire consumes him, Odwald will thank the hero for helping him find some measure of peace.

***If Odwald is dead,*** the Dean will offer to sacrifice himself, though he won't protest if a player takes his place. Either way, the Dean or the player in the ritual circle will see Odwald's ghost supplying them with even more power. Miraculously, Odwald will keep the sacrificial character alive.

The final moments of the ritual begins:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The land around the Grove quakes, as both the conjuring circle and *the Borealus* within are consumed in a harmonious white light. The ground beneath the seal shakes and swells, rising from the ashen plain as though it were a living creature. Those outside the circle can see the mound thrash, momentarily assuming the form of the aspect. It lashes out in fury, before its shape melts away into the earth, which rises still. Then, without warning, everything stops. The quakes cease, leaving a tranquil hill on the ashen plain.
^152

Anyone inside the circle, including any sacrifice (besides Odwald), can be found unconscious at the top of the hill. Both *the Borealus* and the aspect are gone, and from atop the hill a single sapling grows. The threat to the Wood has ended.

## Epilogue

After the final battle, the characters will return to Alderheart to the cheer and jubilation of all. The Wood has been badly scarred, but once the aspect was sealed, the creatures assailing the forest fled back toward the Grove, and much of the Wood survives. In the coming days the characters can recover from their wounds and finish up any unresolved points they might have in their character arcs before the Council summons them to a ceremony celebrating their momentous feat.

Each character is given a medal bearing Alderheart's crest, and their choice of either a [blade of the wood](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/blade-of-the-wood-hwcs.md), [wing crest shield](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/wing-crest-shield-hwcs.md), [red-feather bow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/red-feather-bow-hwcs.md), or [feathered helm](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/feathered-helm-hwcs.md). These rewards should be decided upon before the ceremony, and made to the character's exact specifications (so long as they fit within what the weapons could be. For example, the blade of the wood might be a rapier or a greatsword, but it would need to be a sword). If the [feathered helm](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/feathered-helm-hwcs.md) is selected, the player can choose which race of birdfolk the feather is sourced from:

- If a corvum feather, it will have been one recovered from Odwald before his sacrifice—or if this doesn't make sense, one donated by Professor Revayne.  
- If a gallus feather, Council Speaker Bita will provide it.  
- If a luma feather, it will be one belonging to Dean Windsworth.  
- If a raptor feather, it will come from either the captain of the Perch Guard or Professor Birchwalker.  
- If a strig feather, it will come from Riffin.  

If there are any custom birdfolk NPCs, especially ones with whom the players have an affinity, consider having the feather come from one of them instead. A birdfolk party member may also donate a feather for the helm. Once the characters have received their medals and gifts from the Council, they are bestowed the title "Champions of Humblewood." There is a parade in Alderheart and a great feast to follow, but the story doesn't end here...

Humblewood will undergo a great period of change in the coming months. Based on the choices made by the players, the fate of the Wood will be different. Decide whichever scenario is best given the actions of the party up to this point.

### The Wood

Within a few months, the parts of the Wood that were recently consumed by the Scorched Grove return to normal, and the creatures of the Grove return to their natural ranges. As the forest heals, new settlements are constructed for those who wish to return to their lives on the forest floor. While it's impossible to replace everything lost in the fires, these homes will eventually grow into new communities. Riffin will return to Ashbarrow, and enlist to help the restoration efforts. Ashbarrow will recover its former beauty and provide a home for those who were forced to abandon it.

### Perch-Dwellers and Forest-Dwellers

***If Benna was reasoned with,*** the Wildwood Brigade is now well-established. While small groups of raiders and brigands still beleaguer the roads, organized banditry in Humblewood on the scale of the Coalition appears to be a thing of the past.

After much deliberation, the new Humblewood Council has been established, and includes humblefolk delegates for a handful of prominent forest-dwelling communities. The Perch of Marshview has a humblefolk delegate, as the predominantly grounded settlement's birdfolk representative was replaced in a landslide vote. Council Speaker Bita retains her position, to the applause of a far more inclusive Alderheart.

Trunk infrastructure within Alderheart is being expanded in the lower levels, and there are talks about improving living conditions in the roots, though there is still much to do in this regard. Humblewood appears to be entering its next golden age in birdfolk-humblefolk relations.

***If Benna was killed,*** she has since become a folk hero among certain groups of forest-dwellers. She was seen as the one who could have helped cast aside the oppressive yoke of the perches and bring about a true redistribution of power in the Wood. This is a change that is sorely needed, and now that forest refugees have fought side by side with the Alderites, many are pushing for a true reform of the Birdfolk Council. The hope is to transform it into something that also represents delegates from outside the perches. The popular support for change means it will likely happen, even though there are already signs that most of the powerful nobles in Alderheart are opposed to the change.

Harsher sentences for bandits and thieves are being called for by Alderheart's elite, and the news on the wind is that the Bandit Coalition is still around. Though broken, it survives to cause trouble for merchants who can't afford an escort.

### The Tenders and the Grove

The Scorched Grove has shrunk in recent months, owing to the efforts of Tenders as much as the sealing of the aspect. While the Grove will remain part of Humblewood for the foreseeable future, the ash in its plains no longer burns with embers, reducing the frequency of fires in the Wood. The ashsnakes that appeared with the aspect remain, and have filled new niches in the ecology of the Grove, due to the snake's ability to survive on the energy of consumed elementals and beasts. The ashsnakes help keep some of the more dangerous fire-based creatures at bay. This has greatly helped the Tenders, who now see the ashsnakes as something to be respected from a distance, but not feared. Plants are growing on the lonely hill which marks the final resting place of the aspect of fire, and the sapling which sprouted from its top is quickly growing into a tree. It has been named "The Healing Hill," and is watched over by the Tenders as a sacred site.

### To Be Continued...

One night, a player's character, will have strange dreams. In the dreams, they encounter Odwald. His form is spectral and he appears to have something to say, but before he can impart any new wisdom, the character wakes up. Who was the entity that tricked him into releasing the aspect? If they could cause such destruction in Humblewood, what might happen to Everden if they're still out there?
