# Perfect Landing
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 47*  

Years of living at great heights have taught you how to fall more gracefully. You gain the following benefits:

- Reduce the damage die for fall damage from a d6 to a d4.  
- You do not fall prone after taking falling damage.  
- You do not take damage for the first 30 feet of your fall.
