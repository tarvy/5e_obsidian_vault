# Opportunistic Thief
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 47*  

You have learned the tricks of the trade of thievery, allowing you to exploit opportunities for pick-pocketing both in and out of combat. You gain the following benefits:

- When a creature fails a melee attack roll against you in combat, you can make a Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check against a DC equal to 10 + the target's Dexterity modifier. On a success, you may steal any one item that is not being held or worn by the target.  
- Whenever you successfully use your [Sleight of Hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand) skill outside of combat to steal an object, you may immediately conceal it flawlessly on your person, or put another object you possess in its place.
