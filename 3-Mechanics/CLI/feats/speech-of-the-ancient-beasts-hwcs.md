# Speech of the Ancient Beasts
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 47*  

You have a special connection with the natural world. Great beasts regard you as their kin, and you possess the ability to speak the languages of the most powerful and mystic of their kind. You gain the following benefits:

- Beasts of Large size or larger have a friendly disposition toward you unless you have attacked them.  
- You have advantage on Charisma checks made against beasts that are of Large size or larger.  
- You can speak and understand Giant Eagle, Giant Elk, and Giant Owl. You can otherwise be understood by any beast of Large size or larger, whether or not they speak a language. Beasts with Intelligence scores of 4 or lower may only be able to understand simple concepts.
