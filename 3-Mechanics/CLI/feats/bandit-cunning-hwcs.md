# Bandit Cunning
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 47*  

Your time as a bandit has granted you a sense for danger, and made you skilled at sizing up opponents. You gain the following benefits:

- When you are asked to make a saving throw, you may spend your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier as an additional bonus to the saving throw. You cannot use this ability again until you have completed a long rest.  
- During combat, you can use your action to make an Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check against any creature you have seen fight. As long as you succeed against a DC of 10 + their challenge rating, you can learn one useful fact of your choice about the target's combat abilities. Choose from:  
-     - one damage resistance or immunity    
        - one condition immunity    
        - one special ability possessed by the creature that either does damage, or prevents damage    
        - one option under their attack, legendary, or reaction actions    
        - one special sense they possess
