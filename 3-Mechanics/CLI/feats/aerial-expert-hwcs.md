# Aerial Expert
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 47*  

**Prerequisite**: Glide trait

Years of practice or an innate talent have made you adept at gliding. You gain the following benefits:

- You no longer need to move at least 10 feet to perform long and high jumps. You may choose whether the jump uses your Strength or Dexterity score for determining height or distance, and you double the distance you would normally leap in either case.  
- You may take the [Dash](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash) action while gliding to fly an additional distance up to your movement speed.  
- You may change direction freely while gliding, and may gain up to 10 feet of altitude once before you finish your descent.
