# Heavy Glider
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 47*  

**Prerequisite**: Glide trait

You were either born with great strength, or trained hard to allow yourself to glide under circumstances most would find impossible. You gain the following benefits:

- You may glide while holding a heavy weapon and wearing heavy armor as long as you aren't encumbered.  
- You may choose to land your glide in a space occupied by a hostile creature that is Large or smaller. If you do so, you may roll an opposed Strength check against the creature. On a success, you push them 10 feet away and knock them [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) with the force of your impact. On a failure you land in the nearest un-occupied space.
