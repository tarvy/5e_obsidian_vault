# Hunter's Mark
*1st-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra `1d6` damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have advantage on any Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) or Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check you make to find it. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration) on the spell for up to 8 hours. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration) on the spell for up to 24 hours.

**Classes**: [Paladin (Oath of Vengeance)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/paladin-oath-of-vengeance.md), [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/ranger.md)
