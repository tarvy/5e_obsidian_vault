# Haste
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a shaving of licorice root
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the [Attack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) (one weapon attack only), [Dash](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash), [Disengage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Disengage), [Hide](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Hide), or [Use an Object](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Use%20an%20Object) action.

When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

**Classes**: [Druid (Circle of the Land)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/druid-circle-of-the-land.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Paladin (Oath of Vengeance)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/paladin-oath-of-vengeance.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)
