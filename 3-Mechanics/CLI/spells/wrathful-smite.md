# Wrathful Smite
*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your attack deals an extra `1d6` psychic damage. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of you until the spell ends. As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.
