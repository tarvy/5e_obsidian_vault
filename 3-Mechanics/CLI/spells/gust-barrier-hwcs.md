You spread your arms wide, allowing yourself to become enveloped by the air around you. Until the end of your next turn, any ranged attack against you is made with disadvantage.

Melee attackers who successfully hit you must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the attacker is flung away from you up to 10 feet and is knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).
