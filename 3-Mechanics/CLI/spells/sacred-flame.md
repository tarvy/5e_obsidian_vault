Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `1d8` radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.

The spell's damage increases by `1d8` when you reach 5th level (`2d8`), 11th level (`3d8`), and 17th level (`4d8`).

**Classes**: [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric.md)
