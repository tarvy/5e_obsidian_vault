# Blindness/Deafness
*2nd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is either [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded) or [deafened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#deafened) (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
