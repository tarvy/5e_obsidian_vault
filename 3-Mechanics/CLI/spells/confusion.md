# Confusion
*4th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, three nut shells
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.

An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a `d10` at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

**Confusion Behavior**

`dice: [](confusion.md#^confusion-behavior)`

| dice: d10 | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| 1 | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a `d8` and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn. |
| 2-6 | The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn. |
| 7-8 | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn. |
| 9-10 | The creature can act and move normally. |
^confusion-behavior

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.
