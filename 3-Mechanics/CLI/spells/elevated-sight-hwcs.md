# Elevated Sight
*1st-level, Divination*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/spells/HWCS/Elevated-Sight.webp#right)  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cast your eyes skyward, granting you sight from a higher vantage point. You project your vision to see through an invisible sensor which appears in a spot up to 120 feet above you. You can see through the sensor as if you were flying, granting a full 360 degree view from its location.

The sensor moves with you, retaining its height in relation to you. You can use a bonus action to adjust the sensor's height, but only to a maximum of 120 feet above you.

While looking through this sensor you are [blind](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded), though you can switch between seeing through the sensor or through your own eyes at any time during your turn.

**Classes**: [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric.md), [Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/druid.md), [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/ranger.md), [Warlock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/warlock.md), [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)
