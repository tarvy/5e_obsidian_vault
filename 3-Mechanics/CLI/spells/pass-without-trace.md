# Pass without Trace
*2nd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

**Classes**: [Cleric (Trickery Domain)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric-trickery-domain.md), [Druid (Circle of the Land)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/druid-circle-of-the-land.md), [Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/druid.md), [Monk (Way of Shadow)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/monk-way-of-shadow.md), [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/ranger.md)
