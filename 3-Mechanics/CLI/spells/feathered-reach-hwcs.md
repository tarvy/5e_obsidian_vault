# Feathered Reach
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/spells/HWCS/Feathered-Reach.webp#right)  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S, a small feather
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You transform your arms into powerful wings, and your fingers into long, graceful feathers. The effects of this spell last 1 minute, at which point the feathers gradually fall out, causing you to float gently to the ground as your arms return to their original form. This spell confers a number of benefits upon the caster:

- As a bonus action, you can fly up to double your movement speed. You must land once you finish your movement, although you do not take fall damage while this spell is active, as your feathered arms bear you gently to the ground.  
- You can use your powerful feathered arms to propel yourself upward a distance equal to half your movement speed. You can do this once during your turn and may use it in conjunction with a regular jump.  
- When falling, you can use your reaction to stiffen your arms, and glide on the wind. You may fly up to your movement speed, in any direction, choosing where you land.  
- You gain advantage on all [Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics) checks used to make a long or high jump. You do not need to move 10 feet before you jump to gain distance, and you triple the distance you would jump normally.  

In order to benefit from this spell your hands must be free of shields and heavy weapons, and you cannot be encumbered.
