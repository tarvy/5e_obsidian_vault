# Mordenkainen's Sword
*7th-level, Evocation*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/spells/PHB/Mordenkainen%27s%20Sword.webp#right)  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.

When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes `3d10` force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.

**Classes**: [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/bard.md), [Cleric (Arcana Domain)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric-arcana-domain-scag.md), [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)
