# [Lesser Demon](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/lesser-demon-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 184*  

For those still new to the art of summoning, a fumbled attempt to conjure forth an entity of great power often results in the appearance of a lesser demon in its place. These beings are lowly, vexing creatures, eager to sow discord wherever they have been called.

## Vile and Malicious

While there are all manner of devils and demons that seek to terrorize the good folk of the world, others are more off-putting and disgusting—an embarrassing blunder for the fledgling witch or wizard whose invocation went awry. Although not particularly powerful, lesser demons can still pose a serious threat to inexperienced conjurors and unsuspecting civilians.

    \ that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a DC\
    \ 11 Constitution saving throw against the poison. On a failed save, the creature\
    \ spends its action on that turn retching and reeling. Creatures immune to poison\
    \ are immune to this effect. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses\
    \ the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) will disperse\
