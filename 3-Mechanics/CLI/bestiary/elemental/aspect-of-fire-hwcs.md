The aspect of fire is an elemental creature of fire and molten rock, whose gargantuan frame could easily be mistaken for a small mountain. The aspect is not only a creature of heat and energy, but also of destruction and rage, and it appears to draw strength from the forests its flames consume.

## Primal Incarnation

A creature of legend, it is believed by some that this was the "being of fire and destruction" said to have caused the Great Calamity that created the Scorched Grove many centuries ago. The aspect possesses frightening power, enough to cause serious harm to the Wood and all those who inhabit it. Long has it been forgotten that the creature was conjured in a lost ritual. Shortly afterwards, it was sealed away beneath the Scorched Grove where its presence has continued to affect the region. Centuries of dormancy have weakened the aspect, as its essence has seeped into the surrounding land. Since being released, it has begun to amass power for itself by consuming plants, trees, and other living beings in flame. Once it attains enough energy to completely break the mystical fetters that tie it to the Scorched Grove, it will be an unstoppable force that could very well bring fiery ruin to all of Humblewood.

## Stirring in its Slumber

The strange occurrences of late have many prominent scholars baffled: unusually aggressive emberbats, the appearance of ashsnakes, the increased frequency of forest fires, and many other phenomena which have never been seen before in Humblewood. More than mere legend, the aspect is the reason for all of these. As a creature of primordial fire, it is inextricably bound to the plane of its element. Even as it slumbered beneath the Grove for generations, the aspect has stirred, its presence causing a weakening in the barrier which keeps the material plane separate from the plane of fire, allowing for weaker creatures to slip through.

The aspect's essence has also seeped into the Scorched Grove, causing the landscape to take on far stronger elemental properties than before. The fundamental shift in the Grove's nature has effectively thwarted the efforts of the Tenders, who have for so long sought to heal this burned land. As the aspect continues to grow in power, more of this harmful elemental energy will be released, and even more powerful creatures will arise from the flames. If this otherworldly power spreads across the forest unchecked, all of Humblewood might suffer the fate of the Scorched Grove.
