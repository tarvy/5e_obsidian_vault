# Mummy Lord

## Lair actions
_Source: Monster Manual_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the mummy lord takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the mummy lord can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Each undead creature in the lair can pinpoint the location of each living creature within 120 feet of it until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- Each undead in the lair has advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- Until initiative count 20 on the next round, any non-undead creature that tries to cast a spell of 4th level or lower in the mummy lord's lair is wracked with pain. The creature can choose another action, but if it tries to cast the spell, it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `1d6` necrotic damage per level of the spell, and the spell has no effect and is wasted.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual_

A mummy lord's temple or tomb is warped in any of the following ways by the creature's dark presence:

- Food instantly molders and water instantly evaporates when brought into the lair. Other non magical drinks are spoiled - wine turning to vinegar, for instance.  
- [Divination](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/divination.md) spells cast within the lair by creatures other than the mummy lord have a 25% chance chance to provide misleading results, as determined by the DM. If a [divination](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/divination.md) spell already has a chance to fail or become unreliable when cast multiple times, that chance increases by 25 percent.  
- A creature that takes treasure from the lair is cursed until the treasure is returned. The cursed target has disadvantage on all saving throws. The curse lasts until removed by a [remove curse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or other magic.  

If the mummy lord is destroyed, these regional effects end immediately.
