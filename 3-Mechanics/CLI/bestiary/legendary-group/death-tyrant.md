# Death Tyrant

## Lair actions
_Source: Monster Manual_

When fighting inside its lair, a death tyrant can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the death tyrant can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- An area that is a 50-foot cube within 120 feet of the tyrant is filled with spectral eyes and tentacles. To creatures other than the death tyrant, that area is lightly obscured and difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- Walls sprout spectral appendages until initiative count 20 on the round after next. Any creature, including one on the Ethereal Plane, that is hostile to the tyrant and starts its turn within 10 feet of a wall must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled). Escaping requires a successful DC 17 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check.  
- A spectral eye opens in the air at a point within 50 feet of the tyrant. One random eye ray of the tyrant shoots from that eye, which is considered to be an ethereal source, at a target of the tyrant's choice. The eye then closes and disappears.  

The death tyrant can't repeat an effect until all three have been used, and it can't use the same effect on consecutive rounds.

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual_

A region containing a death tyrant's lair is warped by the creature's unnatural presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Creatures within 1 mile of the tyrant's lair sometimes feel as if they're being watched even when they aren't.  
- When a creature hostile to the tyrant and aware of its existence finishes a long rest within 1 mile of the tyrant's lair, roll a `d20` for that creature. On a roll of 10 or lower, the creature is subjected to one random eye ray of the tyrant.  

If the death tyrant dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
