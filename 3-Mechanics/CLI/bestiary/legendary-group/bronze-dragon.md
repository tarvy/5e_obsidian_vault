# Bronze Dragon

## Lair actions
_Source: Monster Manual_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the [fog cloud](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fog-cloud.md) spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (`1d10`) thunder damage and be [deafened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#deafened) until the end of its next turn.  

### Additional Lair Actions

At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-bronze-dragon.md) or [ancient](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-bronze-dragon.md)) bronze dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Ocean's Call.** The dragon conjures a swarm of spectral dolphins. Each creature in the water within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (`1d10`) slashing damage; then the swarm vanishes.  
- **Salt Burst.** The dragon chooses a point it can see in the lair. The air in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point bursts with abrasive salt crystals. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) slashing damage.  
- **Whelming Water.** The dragon causes a strong current to course through the water in its lair. The dragon chooses any number of creatures it can see that are standing or swimming in water within 120 feet of it. Each chosen creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).  

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual_

The region containing a legendary bronze dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic.

- Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the [control weather](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/control-weather.md) spell.  
- Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon's lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues.  
- Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds, such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.  

If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in `1d10` days.

### Additional Regional Effects

Any of these effects might appear in the area around a bronze dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:

- **Phantom Escort.** Ghostly naval ships from an ancient armada appear, escorting well-meaning creatures in need of the dragon's help toward the dragon's lair.  
- **Underwater Pursuit.** Sailors glimpse the shadowy, illusory form of a dragon in the depths below them, keeping pace with their vessel.  
- **Unfailing Faithfulness.** Sapient creatures that spend a year within 10 miles of the dragon's lair find it nearly impossible to break a promise.
