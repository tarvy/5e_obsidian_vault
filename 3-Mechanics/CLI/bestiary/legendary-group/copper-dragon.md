# Copper Dragon

## Lair actions
_Source: Monster Manual_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the [spike growth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/spike-growth.md) spell and lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.  
- The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained). A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initiative count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20.  

### Additional Lair Actions

At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-copper-dragon.md) or [ancient](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-copper-dragon.md)) copper dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Laughing Gas.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A cloud of pink gas fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area that fails a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) with laughter until the end of its next turn.  
- **Torpid Energy.** The dragon chooses a creature it can see within 120 feet of it. If the target fails a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, its speed is halved, and it can't use reactions or bonus actions until the end of its next turn.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual_

The region containing a legendary copper dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Magic carvings of the dragon's smiling visage can be seen worked into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.  
- Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are normally unable to speak gain the magical ability to speak and understand Draconic while within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These creatures speak well of the dragon, but can't divulge its whereabouts.  
- Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair are prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters suddenly seem amusing.  

If the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the course of `1d10` days. The other effects end immediately.

### Additional Regional Effects

Either of these effects might appear in the area around a copper dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:

- **Distant Melodies.** The ethereal music of woodwinds and bells can be heard carried on the wind within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.  
- **Starlit Stones.** Standing stones are common on hilltops within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The stones shed dim light in a 10-foot radius at night. (If the dragon dies, the stones remain, but they no longer shed light.)
