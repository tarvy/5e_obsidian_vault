# [Figory Figgins](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/figory-figgins-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 196*  

A slender, blond-furred jerbeen with an affable nature and an unfortunate reputation. Figory has been studying for two years at the Avium, but anxiety about the professors expectations and the complicated schedule needed for featherless students to navigate campus have held him back a full year compared to other students. He has been bullied by his classmates at the Avium, and his recent encounter with the cobblefright has left him deeply unnerved. He desperately wants someone to believe his story and take action against the creature lurking around campus. Figory uses the [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a jerbeen. He is neutral.
