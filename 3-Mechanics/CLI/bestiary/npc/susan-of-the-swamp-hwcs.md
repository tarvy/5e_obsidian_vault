# [Susan of the Swamp](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/susan-of-the-swamp-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 198*  

Susan is an eccentric hedge whose magical aptitude has always been outclassed by her hunger for knowledge. She studied at the Avium for a short time, but left of her own accord to experiment with magics the Avium found unsavory. Susan recently settled in the swamp in the hopes of pursuing her arcane curiosities in peace. She shares her modest home with her beetle familiar, Normal, and spends her time foraging for ingredients, testing spells, and reading mystery novels in addition to tomes of eldritch lore. Though she performs her rituals a safe distance away from the cities and towns, her presence in the region has made the Magistrate of Winnowing Reach uneasy, and he wants her gone. Susan uses the [hedge witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hedge-witch-hwcs.md) stat block. Her alignment is chaotic good.
