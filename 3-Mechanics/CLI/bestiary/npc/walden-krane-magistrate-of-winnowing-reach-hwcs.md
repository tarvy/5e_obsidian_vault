# [Walden Krane, Magistrate of Winnowing Reach](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/walden-krane-magistrate-of-winnowing-reach-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 209*  

A fastidious, easily agitated, middle-aged kindled corvum with drab black feathers. As the Magistrate of Winnowing Reach, he is a prominent political figure in the region. Walden isn't a particularly good or kind man, but he tries to be a reasonable and honorable one. He will not break his bargains, and likewise won't tolerate anything on the party's part which could be conceived as oath-breaking, dishonesty, or actions that might bring harm to the Reach. He cares deeply for his citizens, but that sometimes fails to come across as his political ambitions tend to get in the way. Walden has known Kenna Brightspark since she was but a fledgeling. Walden uses the [noble](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a kindled corvum. He is lawful neutral.
