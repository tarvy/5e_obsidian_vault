# [Kenna Brightspark](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kenna-brightspark-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 200*  

An energetic and curious young dusk corvum scholar who is currently working on a dissertation in Winnowing Reach. Kenna's research focuses on the properties of various slimes around the region. She is a student of the Avium, and hopes her findings will earn her a grant to fund yet more study of these fascinating creatures. Kenna is a native of Winnowing Reach, and knows the village well. She is a little precocious and takes risks for her work. Kenna uses the [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a dusk corvum. She is chaotic good.
