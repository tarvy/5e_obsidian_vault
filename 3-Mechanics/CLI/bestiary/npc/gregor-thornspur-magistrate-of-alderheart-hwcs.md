# [Gregor Thornspur, Magistrate of Alderheart](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gregor-thornspur-magistrate-of-alderheart-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 198*  

Gregor is a dull-looking sable luma with a single errant feather that sticks out oddly from his brow. Gregor is the Magistrate of Alderheart, and though he appears to be a tired bureaucrat, his demeanour hides a shrewd businessman eager to turn any situation to his advantage. He is not above taking bribes in exchange for expediting requests to see the Birdfolk Council. Gregor uses the [noble](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of sable luma. He is chaotic neutral.
