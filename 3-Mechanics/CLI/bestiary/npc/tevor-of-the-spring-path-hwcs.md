# [Tevor of the Spring Path](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tevor-of-the-spring-path-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 207*  

Tevor is a timid sable luma, with ruddy gray feathers and a short beak. He is a good friend of Havel, and has begun to feel affection for the gallus since their time working together. Tevor is a Sapling, a low ranking member of the Tenders, who barely escaped from an ashsnake attack that killed his mentor. While he has agreed to give his report of events in the Scorched Grove, he is not prepared to do much beyond this. He possesses conviction in the beliefs of his order, but the traumatic event has left him feeling frightened and helpless. If only he could find the courage to match his ideals, he would be destined for greatness. Tevor is generally averse to combat now, but before joining the Tenders he trained as a perch guard recruit.
