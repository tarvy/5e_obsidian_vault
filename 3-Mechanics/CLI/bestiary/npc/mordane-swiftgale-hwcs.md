# [Mordane Swiftgale](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mordane-swiftgale-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 203*  

Mordane is a prim-and-proper elderly swift strig, who keeps his gray and white feathers preened, and his librarian robes freshly pressed. He is wise but old fashioned, and prefers to read in solitude when off shift, rather than fraternize with his peers. Despite his social shortcomings, he's an experienced librarian, and has incredible knowledge of even the oldest parts of the lower library. Mordane uses the [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a swift strig. He is neutral.
