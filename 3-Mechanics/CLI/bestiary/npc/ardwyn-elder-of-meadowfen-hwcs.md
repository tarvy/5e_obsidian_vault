# [Ardwyn, Elder of Meadowfen](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ardwyn-elder-of-meadowfen-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 190*  

A venerable huden gallus with rounded grouse-like proportions and feathers that have long since lost the sheen of youth. As the village Elder, Ardwyn is a figure of authority within Meadowfen. She and her late husband kept the village running until his death, after which she took on the role alone. Elder Ardwyn is a kind and perceptive woman who exudes leadership. The villagers look to her for guidance. Ardwyn uses the [priest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a huden gallus. She is neutral good.
