# [Krall, the Scavenger King](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/krall-the-scavenger-king-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 202*  

Krall is an imposing mapach, standing nearly 6 feet tall with a solid build and matted fur that is missing in patches. He was close friends with Benna, although he didn't share her altruism and instead believed that those who couldn't carry their weight should be left behind. He expects complete loyalty from his followers, and favors hit-and-run tactics. He and his troops exact tolls on poorly-defended caravans for passage along the roads, which many pay to avoid his wrath. Krall uses the [mapach brute](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-brute-hwcs.md) stat block.
