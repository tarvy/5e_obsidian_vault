# [Riffin, the Ash-Knight](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/riffin-the-ash-knight-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 204*  

Riffin is a small stout strig, standing a few inches over three feet, whose plumage and proportions resemble a little owl. A traveling knight of the realm, Riffin lived in Ashbarrow before its destruction, and was carried to Alderheart by his friend Odwald, who saved him from the fire. Being one of the only knights to hail from Ashbarrow, folk began calling him the "Ash-Knight," a title which he now uses to keep the memory of his home alive. Riffin is a simple strig with a charming way of viewing the world. He is also a steadfast warrior who strongly believes in doing what is right, helping those in need, and honoring his debts. Riffin uses the [strig knight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/strig-knight-hwcs.md) stat block. His alignment is lawful good.
