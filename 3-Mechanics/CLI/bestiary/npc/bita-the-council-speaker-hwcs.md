# [Bita, the Council Speaker](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/bita-the-council-speaker-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 193*  

Bita is a bright gallus whose elegant white plumage resembles that of a peacock. As the Birdfolk Council's Speaker, she is always first to address those who have been granted an audience with the Council. She takes her duties as the Speaker and as a Council member very seriously. Despite her profound affection for Humblewood and its citizens, she often comes off as severe and cold. Bita believes in doing what's best for the folks of the Wood, and sometimes this means making level-headed, tough decisions. Bita uses the [noble](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a bright gallus. She is lawful good.
