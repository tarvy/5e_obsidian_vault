# [Havel of the Autumn Moon](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/havel-of-the-autumn-moon-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 207*  

Havel is a frail but courageous huden gallus, with pheasant-like plumage. He is a dear friend of Tevor, and the two have fallen for each other during their time together in Alderheart. Havel is a Summerblossom, a rank given to experienced members of the Tenders. He has been working at the Tenders' headquarters in the Trunk district, where he provides aid to the refugees. He is also skilled in the use of natural magic, and while normally too sickly to adventure, could still assist the party with his talents.
