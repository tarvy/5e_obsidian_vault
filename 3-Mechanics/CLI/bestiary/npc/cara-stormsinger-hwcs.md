# [Cara Stormsinger](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/cara-stormsinger-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 191*  

A tawny-feathered swift strig woman from Meadowfen, Cara is the captain of the village militia. She was responsible for assembling the team of villagers who went out to investigate the black plume of smoke that appeared over Meadowfen's horizon. She endured a harrowing journey to return home and relay Ashbarrow's fate to Elder Ardwynn. Cara uses the birdfolk militia stat block adjusted with the racial traits of a swift strig. She is lawful good.
