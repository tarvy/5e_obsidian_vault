# [Rhys Birchwalker](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rhys-birchwalker-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 203*  

An associate professor of conjuration at the Avium, this middle-aged mistral raptor has little in the way of mystic talent, but she makes up for it with an enthusiasm for learning and a wealth of knowledge on her chosen subject. She is well-versed in conjuratory theory, and can provide characters with any of the information they would otherwise find in **Conjuration Magic** (see Into the Library) if she is asked about the subject directly. Professor Birchwalker can also help a character perform the calculations to find the location of the conjuration circle within the Grove. Rhys uses the [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a mistral raptor. She is neutral good.
