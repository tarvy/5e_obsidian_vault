# [Gabe Windsworth](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gabe-windsworth-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 202*  

Gabe is a middle-aged sable luma with a large plume of iridescent feathers that surround his nape like a cowl. The Dean of the Avium, Gabe always appears as though he is deep in thought. Though his amiability and kooky behavior cause people to underestimate him, beneath the quirky exterior lies a keen mind that carefully evaluates all possibilities before taking action. He is a good-natured scholar who is just as concerned with the wellbeing of his staff and students as he is with the quality of research and education within the Avium. Dean Windsworth uses the [luma wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/luma-wizard-hwcs.md) stat block. His alignment is neutral good.
