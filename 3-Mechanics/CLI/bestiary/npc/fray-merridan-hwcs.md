# [Fray Merridan](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/fray-merridan-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 207*  

Fray is a dashing red-furred vulpin with sharp eyes and a quick wit. A highly skilled swordswoman, she was left without a home when forest fires spreading from the Scorched Grove burned her village. She saw joining the bandits as an opportunity to use her skills to provide for herself and those she cares for. She is astute and talented, but also competitive and unwilling to forget even the smallest slight against her. Fray uses the [vulpin captain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vulpin-captain-hwcs.md) stat block.
