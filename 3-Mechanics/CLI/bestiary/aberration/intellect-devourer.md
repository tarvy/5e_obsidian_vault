# [Intellect Devourer](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/intellect-devourer.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 191*  

An intellect devourer resembles a walking brain protected by a crusty covering and set on bestial clawed legs. This foul aberration feeds on the intelligence of sentient creatures, taking over a victim's body on behalf of its mind flayer masters.

## Illithid Creations

Mind flayers breed intellect devourers to serve as roaming hunters of the Underdark, creating an intellect devourer by taking the brain of a thrall and subjecting it to a horrible ritual. As it sprouts legs, the brain becomes an intelligent predator as twisted and evil as its masters.

## Deadly Puppet Masters

An intellect devourer consumes a creature's mind and memories, then turns the host body into a puppet under its control. An intellect devourer typically uses its puppet host to lure others into the domain of the mind flayers to be enthralled or consumed.

    \ out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a [wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md).\
    \ By spending 5 feet of its movement, the intellect devourer can voluntarily leave\
    \ the body, teleporting to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The\
    \ body then dies, unless its brain is restored within 1 round."
