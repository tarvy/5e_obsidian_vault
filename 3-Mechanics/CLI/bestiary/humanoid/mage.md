# [Mage](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 347. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

Mages spend their lives in the study and practice of magic. Good-aligned mages offer counsel to nobles and others in power, while evil mages dwell in isolated sites to perform unspeakable experiments without interference.
