# [Cervan Priest](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/cervan-priest-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 193*  

Cervan villages are typically led by a community elder who is wise both in politics as well as the ways of the Amaranthine. Priests provide guidance to the community, ensuring that rituals are properly observed and customs upheld. As storytellers and keepers of a village's history, they are trusted with the myths and folktales used to impart knowledge necessary for survival in the forest.
