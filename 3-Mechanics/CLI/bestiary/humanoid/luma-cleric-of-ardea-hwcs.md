# [Luma Cleric of Ardea](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/luma-cleric-of-ardea-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 201*  

Clerics of Ardea travel the Wood on holy pilgrimages to sacred groves resplendent with life fostered by the Dawnmother. They spread Ardea's message of kindness wherever they go, taking it upon themselves to protect all life, great and small. Clerics serve the communities they pass through as healers, mediators, and occasionally as valiant defenders. Lumas who heed the call of the Amaranthine find their natural charisma and mystic talents to be of great help as they walk the cleric's path.
