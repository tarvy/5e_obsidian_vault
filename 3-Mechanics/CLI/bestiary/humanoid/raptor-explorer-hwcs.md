# [Raptor Explorer](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/raptor-explorer-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 203*  

Whether drawn by tales of treasure or the allure of faraway lands, some residents of Humblewood journey to seek out distant ruins or remote vistas to satisfy their wanderlust. Explorers are common among raptors, many of whom do so out of veneration for the Amaranthine Reya, the guide and protector of travelers. Numerous explorers embark on such adventures for the sake of self-discovery and personal growth. Those who have made a life out of exploring often find their service as guides in high demand.
