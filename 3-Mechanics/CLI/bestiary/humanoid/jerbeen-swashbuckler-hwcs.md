# [Jerbeen Swashbuckler](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-swashbuckler-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 200*  

A common figure in many jerbeen folktales, a swashbuckler is a champion who fights with finesse and daring. Natural leaders, swashbucklers keep their wits about them during a duel, pressing small advantages to win the day. Jerbeen swashbucklers often train in the tradition of their Amaranthine, Gaspard. Each year swashbucklers participate in fencing matches held in Gaspard's honor. Not all swashbucklers follow this path, with some using their talents for brigandry.
