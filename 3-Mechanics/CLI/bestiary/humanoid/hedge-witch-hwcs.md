# [Hedge Witch](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hedge-witch-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 198*  

Many who apply to study at the Avium are turned away by the prestigious institution. Spurred by their desire for knowledge, rejected candidates sometimes start on a path to become self-taught masters of arcana. Notably in tune with the magic of the forest, hedges pursuing an individualistic path often leverage their connection to these natural forces to make pacts with powerful fey or elemental beings, learning secrets inaccessible to traditional students.
