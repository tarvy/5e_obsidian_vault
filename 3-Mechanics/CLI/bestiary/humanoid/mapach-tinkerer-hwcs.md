# [Mapach Tinkerer](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-tinkerer-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 203*  

Unlike those who are content to stay within the boundaries of their established craft, tinkerers have a passion for innovation that is unfettered by tradition. Mapach craftspeople who constantly look for ways to improve upon past creations find themselves branded as eccentrics. Their methods are unconventional, but eminently practical. Designs are often carefully considered, and some of their innovations eventually find widespread use around the Wood.

    \ the tinkerer can use each one no more than once per day:\n\n1. Cogwork Bird.\

    \ creature within 30 feet and distracts it. The next attack against that creature\
    \ is made with advantage.\n\n2. Flash-bangs. The tinkerer targets a space\
    \ up to 10 ft. away, and throws some small explosive shells that flare up in a\
    \ blinding light. All creatures within 10 ft. of the target space must make a\
    \ DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded)\

    \ saving throw or take 5 (1d10) piercing damage.\n\n4. Grease Balloon. The\
    \ tinkerer targets a 10-foot by 10-foot area up to 15 feet away, and makes it\
    \ slick with grease. The area is considered difficult terrain, and each creature\
    \ standing in the area must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or fall\
    \ [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone). A creature that enters\
    \ the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving\
    \ throw or fall [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone)."
