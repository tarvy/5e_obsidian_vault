# [Birdfolk Guard](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-guard-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 191*  

Aspiring recruits from all over the Wood flock to the Perch Guard headquarters in the capital of Alderheart to join their ranks. After successful training, these newly sworn guards return to their home perch. They serve with pride, acting as the perch's first line of defense. Under the Humblefolk Treaty, members of the Perch Guard are tasked to aid nearby villages on the forest floor whenever necessary. In larger cities like Alderheart, the Perch Guard are also responsible for dealing with inner city issues such as robbery, bar fights, and investi-gating and arresting criminals.
