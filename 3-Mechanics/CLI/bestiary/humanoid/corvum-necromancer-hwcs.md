# [Corvum Necromancer](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/corvum-necromancer-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 194*  

Every sentient being is susceptible to the lure of necromancy. The promise of seeing lost loved ones again, or raising an army of powerful minions, can sometimes be difficult to resist. The birdfolk of Humblewood are not immune to that lure. To help curb this curiosity, professors at The Avium teach necromantic theory only. But some intrepid students have been known to pursue the practical applications in secret. Sure of their intellect, corvums in particular are often willing to challenge traditions for the sake of knowledge. As a result, more than one corvum has wandered down the path of the dark arts.
