# [Gallus Monk](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gallus-monk-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 196*  

Gallus who are not content to settle into everyday life in small communities venture out to secluded monasteries and learn the way of the monk. There, a disciplined routine of physical rigours and spiritual contemplation is overseen by wizened masters. After years of training, initiates are deemed ready to journey the land and put their learning to the test. The majority return to the monastery after having had a revelation during their travels. Other continue to wander, sometimes with a few trusted companions, forever finding new meaning.
