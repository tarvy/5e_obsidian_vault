# [Gallus Druid](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gallus-druid-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 196*  

The gallus of Humblewood have an especially deep connection with nature. Hanera teaches them to see the world from the forest floor, instead of the canopy. This is a message many gallus have taken to heart. Out of this reverence for nature, some gallus dedicate themselves to the study and preservation of the Wood, becoming wardens of the forest, or acting as guides. A select few with a unique connection to flora and fauna develop incredible powers and abilities. These druids can sprout trees and mend injured animals with a touch. They are revered among birdfolk and humblefolk alike as spiritual leaders and wise advisors.

- "desc": "When falling at least 10 feet, the druid can spend a reaction to fly up\
    \ to their speed in one direction as they descend. They land in an unoccupied\
    \ space at the end of their movement, and take no falling damage. They cannot\
    \ glide while carrying heavy objects, heavy weapons, or shields (though they can\
    \ drop any held items as part of their reaction)."

    \ As a bonus action, the druid can move the spirit to another location within\
    \ 60 feet. The spirit lasts for 1 minute.\n\nBear Spirit. The druid and allies\
    \ within the aura gain 9 temporary hit points and have advantage on Strength checks\
