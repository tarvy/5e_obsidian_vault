# [Birdfolk Dockmaster](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-dockmaster-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 190*  

It may be odd to see birdfolk working the docks and ships of Saltar's Port, but the sea is a way of life for some folk. Jobs in the seafaring industry are as lucrative as they are tough. For the birdfolk that choose to ply their trade on the water, life is about order and efficiency. One improperly stowed barrel or poorly lashed line can spell disaster on the sea. Dockmasters take their marine jobs very seriously.
