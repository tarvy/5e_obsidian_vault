# [Raptor Ranger](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/raptor-ranger-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 203*  

The ranger is an iconic figure in raptor stories and myths, and has inspired many to follow in their legendary footsteps. Outfitted for rough living in the wilds, these rangers are consummate archers and exceptional hunters. With supernatural eyesight and quick reflexes, raptors are ideally suited to the life of a hunter. Many who chose this path find themselves the inspiration for new tales.

The raptor ranger listed is outfitted with a [red-feather bow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/red-feather-bow-hwcs.md) (see "Appendix D: New Magic Items").
