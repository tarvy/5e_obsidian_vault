# [Mapach Brute](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-brute-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 202*  

Although many in the bandit coalition follow noble ideals, there have always been a handful of unreliable members, only concerned with their own advancement. These ruthless brutes are scoundrels through and through, willing to seize power within the coalition by any means necessary. Mapachs don't have more knaves among them as a matter of course, but the infamy of a few such villains has further sullied their reputation in the eyes of perch-dwellers.
