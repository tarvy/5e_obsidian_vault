# [Mapach Bandit](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 202*  

Mapachs are particularly distrusted among birdfolk because of their eccentricities and willingness to break with commonly held customs. Often judged on sight to be crooked, some mapachs find it hard to integrate into birdfolk society and turn to crime to survive. Local bandit forces are happy to exploit this, offering the displaced mapachs shelter and a share of the spoils in exchange for their service.
