# [Corvum Assassin](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/corvum-assassin-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 194*  

Frequently members of criminal organizations, contract killers can be found in the Wood's largest and most politically complex perches. They serve powerful figures with a lack of scruples and an abundance of coin. Assassins are trained from a young age to become deadly masters of their craft, learning how to skulk the branchroads and keep hidden in the canopy to time the perfect ambush. Corvums, with their natural intelligence and cunning, make the best assassins.
