# [Birdfolk Militia](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-militia-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 191*  

In smaller perches, where a guard force may be minimal or nonexistent, town security consists of a locally-organized militia. Anyone can enlist in these groups, provided they are upstanding citizens. They can be called upon by the Perch Guard to perform duties ranging from policing streets to supplementing military efforts.
