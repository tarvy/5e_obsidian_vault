# [Spy](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 349. Available in the SRD.*  

Rulers, nobles, merchants, guildmasters, and other wealthy individuals use spies to gain the upper hand in a world of cutthroat politics. A spy is trained to secretly gather information. Loyal spies would rather die than divulge information that could compromise them or their employers.
