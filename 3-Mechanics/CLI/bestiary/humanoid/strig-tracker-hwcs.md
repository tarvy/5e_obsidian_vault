# [Strig Tracker](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/strig-tracker-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 206*  

Capable of moving swiftly through the wilderness, trackers help find those who have lost their way in the forest. Accomplished survivalists, they are familiar with hidden pathways throughout the Wood. Often found alongside woodland beasts, many have formed bonds with these creatures, and find their aid useful in locating lost travelers. For Strigs, known for being at ease even in the harshest environments, becoming a tracker can prove a satisfying challenge. Some use their skills to double as bounty hunters, which can provide for an even more thrilling chase.
