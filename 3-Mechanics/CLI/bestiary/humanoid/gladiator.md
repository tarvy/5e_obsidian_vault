# [Gladiator](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 346. Available in the SRD.*  

Gladiators battle for the entertainment of raucous crowds. Some gladiators are brutal pit fighters who treat each match as a life-or-death struggle, while others are professional duelists who command huge fees but rarely fight to the death.
