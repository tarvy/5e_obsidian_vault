# [Strig Knight](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/strig-knight-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 204*  

The Perch Guard produces many skilled soldiers, but only those who possess a great degree of talent are trained to become knights. The knights of Alderheart's Perch Guard are taught how to protect others by creating opportunities for allies to regroup or retreat as necessary. Experts in sword-and-shield fighting, the knight's heavily-armoured fighting style allows them to hold the line against even the fiercest of enemies. The strig knight listed is equipped with a [wing crest shield](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/wing-crest-shield-hwcs.md) (see "Appendix D: New Magic Items").
