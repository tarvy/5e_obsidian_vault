# [Hedge Bard](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hedge-bard-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 198*  

Recognized for being excellent diplomats and mediators, hedges are less well known for their love of music. Those who turn their natural charm towards the talent of entertaining can find great success. Some of the most gifted performers are blessed with magical talents. While most hedges use these powers for good, others choose a more sinister path, using their bardic talents to cheat, dupe, or steal from common folk.
