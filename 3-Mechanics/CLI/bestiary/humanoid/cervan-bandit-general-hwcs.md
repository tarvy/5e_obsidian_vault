# [Cervan Bandit General](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/cervan-bandit-general-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 193*  

Bandit clans are commanded by generals. Serving as both a battle-tested warrior and master strategist, they alone coordinate the disparate band of thieves and outlaws that make up the collective. While military monikers are used to refer to bandit leadership, more than combat prowess is needed to maintain order in these volatile organizations. A dominating personality and charismatic voice are as necessary as a swift blade and a sharp mind. Cervans don't typically take to brigandry, but their practical skills and ability to survive in even the most adverse situations make those with loose morals and dubious ambitions a natural fit.
