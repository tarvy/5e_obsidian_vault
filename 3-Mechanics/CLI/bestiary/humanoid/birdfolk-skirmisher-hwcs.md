*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 191*  

The bulk of the Perch Guard's military force are a light infantry called "The Spears." They train relentlessly with polearm weapons perfectly suited for branch-to-branch combat. Many are also skilled at ranged attacks with these weapons, as well as performing special diving maneuvers, making them an even greater threat to enemies below. In times of peace, skirmishers often serve as skilled hunters, following the direction of trackers to collect enough food for entire villages.
