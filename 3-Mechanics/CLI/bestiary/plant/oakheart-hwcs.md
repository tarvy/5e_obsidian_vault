# [Oakheart](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/oakheart-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 203*  

Oakheart is a huge tree-shaped creature with charred bark that smolders in places, and many small flames which burn on his branches, giving the impression of leaves. Once a treant, he bathed in the primal energies of the Scorched Grove, transforming into an entity so thoroughly possessed of the element of flame that he's capable of serving as [The Borealus'](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/borealus-hwcs.md) keeper. He is the artifact's guardian, and will not relinquish the staff until he has been convinced that whoever has disturbed him can control the staff's considerable power, and that they mean to maintain the natural balance he sacrificed himself to protect.
