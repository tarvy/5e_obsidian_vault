# [Hippogriff](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/hippogriff.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 184. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

A beast whose magical origins are lost to history, a hippogriff possesses the wings and forelimbs of an eagle, the hindquarters of a horse, and a head that combines the features of both animals.

Reclusive and omnivorous, hippogriffs mate for life and seldom venture more than a few miles from their nest. When defending its mate or its young, a hippogriff fights to the death. Hippogriffs don't lay eggs but give birth to live young.

Dragons, griffons, and wyverns have a taste for hippogriff meat and frequently prey on these creatures.

## Flying Mounts

A hippogriff raised in captivity can be trained to be a faithful companion and mount. Of all the creatures that can serve as flying mounts, hippogriffs are among the easiest to train and the most loyal once trained properly.
