- "desc": "If the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion,\
    \ it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely\
    \ attached to a surface or larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its\
    \ speed is 0.\n\nWhen the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to\
    \ its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original\
    \ object form.\n\nThe DM might rule that a specific objects slam attack inflicts\
    \ slashing or piercing damage based on its form."
