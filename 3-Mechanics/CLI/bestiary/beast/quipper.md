*Source: Monster Manual p. 335. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

A quipper is a carnivorous fish with sharp teeth.

Quippers can adapt to any aquatic environment, including cold subterranean lakes. They frequently gather in swarms; the statistics for a swarm of quippers appear later in this appendix.
