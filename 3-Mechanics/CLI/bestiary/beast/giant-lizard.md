# [Giant Lizard](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-lizard.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 326. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

A giant lizard can be ridden or used as a draft animal. Lizardfolk also keep them as pets, and subterranean giant lizards are used as mounts and pack animals by drow, duergar, and other Underdark dwellers.

> [!note] Variant: Giant Lizard Traits

> 
> **Spider Climb.** The lizard can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
