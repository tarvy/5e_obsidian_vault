# [Hunter Shark](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/hunter-shark.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 330. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

Smaller than a giant shark but larger and fiercer than a reef shark, a hunter shark haunts deep waters. It usually hunts alone, but multiple hunter sharks might feed in the same area. A fully grown hunter shark is 15 to 20 feet long.
