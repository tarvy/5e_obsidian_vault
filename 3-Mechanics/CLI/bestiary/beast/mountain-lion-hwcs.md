The mountain lions of Humblewood's Crest Mountains are more than the mere beasts travelers may mistake them for. Covered in rocky protrusions that serve to protect as well as camouflage them, mountain lions possess special powers as a result of their ties to the elemental earth of their territory.

## Mountain Stalker

Mountain lions live and hunt in their craggy mountain homes. They are natural climbers and prefer to ambush unsuspecting prey rather than engage in prolonged chases across the treacherous cliffs. A pride of mountain lions is led and protected by a large female. Males compete for the right to mate, and work together as a hunting party. While not as adept at pack hunting as wolves, a few mountain lions working in tandem can take down dangerous creatures of unusual size, including basilisks and griffons.

## Roar of the Earth

Owing to the magic of the elemental earth, mountain lions can gain limited control over nearby rocks with their roar. Using this ability, they can cause rockslides to hinder their prey's escape or inflict critical damage. The ability takes a great deal of energy, so many mountain lions use it sparingly, knowing it will be some time before they can call upon it again.
