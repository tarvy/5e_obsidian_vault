# Suspended Cauldron
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 255*  

A cauldron is an iron pot suspended so that it can be tipped easily, spilling its contents. Once emptied, a cauldron must be refilled-and its contents must usually be reheated-before it can be used again. It takes three actions to fill a cauldron and one action to tip it.

Cauldrons can be filled with other liquids, such as acid or [green slime](/3-Mechanics/CLI/traps-hazards/green-slime.md), with different effects.

## Actions

***Boiling Oil.*** The cauldron pours boiling oil onto a 10-foot-square area directly below it. Any creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
