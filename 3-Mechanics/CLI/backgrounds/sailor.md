# Sailor
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 139*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics), [Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)  
- **Tool Proficiencies.** [Navigator's tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/navigators-tools.md), vehicles (water)  
- **Equipment.** A belaying pin ([club](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/club.md)), [silk rope (50 feet)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/silk-rope-50-feet.md), a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random [trinket](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/trinket.md) on the Trinkets table in chapter 5), a set of [common clothes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/common-clothes.md), and a belt [pouch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pouch.md) containing 10 gp  

You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new.

Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed with your Dungeon Master. Was it a merchant ship, a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship? How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it widely traveled? Is it still sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost with all hands?

What were your duties on board–boatswain, captain, navigator, cook, or some other position? Who were the captain and first mate? Did you leave your ship on good terms with your fellows, or on the run?

## Feature: Ship's Passage

When you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.

## Suggested Characteristics

Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.

`dice: [](sailor.md#^ideal)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Respect. The thing that keeps a ship together is mutual respect between captain and crew. (Good) |
| 2 | Fairness. We all do the work, so we all share in the rewards. (Lawful) |

| 5 | People. I'm committed to my crewmates, not to ideals. (Neutral) |
| 6 | Aspiration. Someday, I'll own my own ship and chart my own destiny. (Any) |
