# Grounded
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 44*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics), [Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)  
- **Tool Proficiencies.** one type of Artisan's Tools  
- **Languages.** one of your choice  
- **Equipment.** a set of Artisan's Tools (your choice), a walking stick, a trinket from another culture, [traveling clothes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/travelers-clothes.md), and a belt [pouch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pouch.md) with 5 gp   

Despite the inherent vertical aspects of birdfolk culture, you have always felt safer and more at peace with your feet firmly planted on the soil. You are practical and level-headed, but due to your different perspective on the world, other bird-folk see you as quirky or unsettling. Your unique insight allows you to connect with the humblefolk who live under the forest canopy in ways perch-dwelling birdfolk cannot.

## An Odd Bird

Among birdfolk you are somewhere between an oddity and an outcast. Some consider your aversion to heights a rejection of birdfolk culture, leading many to find you off-putting. Choose how your community regards you or roll on the table below to determine how you fit in.

| dice: d6 | Community Place |
|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | I am considered weak or unskilled and many treat me like a fledgling. |
| 2 | I am looked upon as a traitor to my people. |
| 3 | My family wants me to return to the perch, but I just can't. |
| 4 | I am not welcome back in my home perch. |
| 5 | I am viewed as an oddity, someone for others to laugh at and tease. |
| 6 | I have found a new community on the forest floor. |

## Feature: Find Another Path

Since you have lived your life close to the ground, you are familiar with the undergrowth in the same way other birdfolk are familiar with the canopy. You can always recall the general layout of the terrain around you while traveling along the forest floor. If your path is ever blocked by an obstacle that requires you to climb or otherwise gain height to circumvent it, you can always find a way around, so long as such a path exists. Additionally, you are adept at finding shelter in the Wood while traveling, and can usually locate a suitable safe shelter (a cave, a tree hollow, or bramble thicket) somewhere on the forest floor for you and up to five other creatures.

## Suggested Characteristics

Birdfolk who are grounded often find ways to cope with their aversion to canopy life. Some have completely forsaken their old lives in favor of new ones in undergrowth communities, while others keep ties with family and friends in the perches where they were born.
