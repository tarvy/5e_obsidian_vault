# Shield of Missile Attraction
*Shield, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Shield%20of%20Missile%20Attraction.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.

## Curse

This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the [remove curse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
