# Borealus
*Staff, major, artifact (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/HWCS/Borealus.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)

This legendary artifact was created by a powerful wizard, crafted from the finger of a towering, ancient elemental aspect of frost. It is so cold to the touch that it numbs any skin it comes into contact with, although an attuned character is immune to this effect.

## Gifts of the Rime

As long as you are attuned to the Borealus, you gain the following benefits:

- You are resistant to fire damage  
- You are immune to cold damage  
- You learn the [ray of frost](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/ray-of-frost.md) cantrip  

## Breath of Winter

While holding the staff you can use your action to unleash an icy-cold blizzard from your open mouth. A 100-foot-cone of hoarfrost blasts forth in a direction of your choice, dealing `9d8` cold damage to all creatures within the cone if they fail a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, or half as much on a success. You can't use this property again until the next dawn.

## Glacial Prison

By using your action to touch the staff to a surface, you can cause a barrier of ice to spring into existence from a point you can see along this surface within 200 feet of you. This effect is otherwise identical to a [wall of ice](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-ice.md) spell cast at 6th level, with a DC 18 for all saving throws related to the effect. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.

## Cruel Winds

Wherever the staff goes, a bitterly cold boreal wind accompanies it. The wind gusts intermittently within 30 feet of the attuned character and extinguishes all non-magical flames it comes into contact with.

## Destroying the Staff

The staff can be destroyed through exposure to flames from a fire elemental of equal power to the being it was crafted from. After centuries of exposure, it will melt away into nothing.
