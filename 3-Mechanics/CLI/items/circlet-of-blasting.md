# Circlet of Blasting
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Circlet%20of%20Blasting.webp#right)  


While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the [scorching ray](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/scorching-ray.md) spell with it. When you make the spell's attacks, you do so with an attack bonus of `+5`. The circlet can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
