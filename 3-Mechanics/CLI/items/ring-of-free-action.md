# Ring of Free Action
*Ring, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Ring%20of%20Free%20Action.webp#right)  


While you wear this ring, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement. In addition, magic can neither reduce your speed nor cause you to be [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) or [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained).
