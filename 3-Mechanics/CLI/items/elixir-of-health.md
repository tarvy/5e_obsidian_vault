# Elixir of Health
*Potion, minor, rare*  


When you drink this potion, it cures any disease afflicting you, and it removes the [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded), [deafened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#deafened), [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed), and [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) conditions. The clear red liquid has tiny bubbles of light in it.
