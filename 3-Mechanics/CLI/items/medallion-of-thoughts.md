# Medallion of Thoughts
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Medallion%20of%20Thoughts.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

The medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the [detect thoughts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-thoughts.md) spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn.
