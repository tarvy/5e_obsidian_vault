# Hag Eye
*Other, unknown (magic)*  


A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes `3d10` psychic damage and is [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded) for 24 hours.

A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded). During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.
