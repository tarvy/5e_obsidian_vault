# Soul Bag
*Other, very rare*  


When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a [night hag](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md)'s Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).
