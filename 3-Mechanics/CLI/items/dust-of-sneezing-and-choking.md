# Dust of Sneezing and Choking
*Wondrous Item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Dust%20of%20Sneezing%20and%20Choking.webp#right)  


Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be [dust of disappearance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/dust-of-disappearance.md), and an [identify](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/identify.md) spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The [lesser restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell can also end the effect on a creature.
