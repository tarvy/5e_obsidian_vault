# Talisman of the Sphere
*Wondrous Item, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Talisman%20of%20the%20Sphere.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

When you make an Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check to control a [sphere of annihilation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sphere-of-annihilation.md) while you are holding this talisman, you double your proficiency bonus on the check. In addition, when you start your turn with control over a [sphere of annihilation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sphere-of-annihilation.md), you can use an action to levitate it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 × your Intelligence modifier.
