![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/HWCS/Red-Feather-Bow.webp#right)  


A prized hunting weapon among mistral raptors, this bow is imbued with magic to help the wielder see their prey from afar.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The bow has 3 charges. When you fire an arrow from this bow, you can speak the command word and use a charge to see through the arrow as a bonus action. You can see from the point your arrow lands as if you were there for 1 minute. If the arrow strikes a creature, you see what they see for the same duration.
