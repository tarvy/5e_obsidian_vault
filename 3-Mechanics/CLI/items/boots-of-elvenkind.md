# Boots of Elvenkind
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Boots%20of%20Elvenkind.webp#right)  


While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks that rely on moving silently.
