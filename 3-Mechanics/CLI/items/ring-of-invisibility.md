# Ring of Invisibility
*Ring, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Ring%20of%20Invisibility.webp#right)  


While wearing this ring, you can turn [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) as an action. Anything you are wearing or carrying is [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) with you. You remain [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) until the ring is removed, until you attack or cast a spell, or until you use a bonus action to become visible again.
