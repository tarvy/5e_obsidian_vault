# Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals
*Wondrous Item, major, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Bowl%20of%20Commanding%20Water%20Elementals.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the bowl's command word and summon a [water elemental](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md), as if you had cast the [conjure elemental](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-elemental.md) spell. The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs 3 pounds and holds about 3 gallons.
