# Necklace of Fireballs
*Wondrous Item, minor, rare*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Necklace%20of%20Fireballs.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This necklace has `1d6 + 3` beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level [fireball](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball.md) spell (save DC 15).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the [fireball](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball.md) by 1 for each bead beyond the first.
