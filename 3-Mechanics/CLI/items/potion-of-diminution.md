# Potion of Diminution
*Potion, minor, rare*  


When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" effect of the [enlarge/reduce](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/enlarge-reduce.md) spell for `1d4` hours (no [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration) required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
