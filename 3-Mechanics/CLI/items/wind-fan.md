# Wind Fan
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Wind%20Fan.webp#right)  


While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the [gust of wind](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind.md) spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20% chance chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.
