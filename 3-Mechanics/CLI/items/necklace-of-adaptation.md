# Necklace of Adaptation
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Necklace%20of%20Adaptation.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as [cloudkill](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cloudkill.md) and [stinking cloud](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/stinking-cloud.md) effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).
