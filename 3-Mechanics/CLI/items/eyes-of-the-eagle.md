# Eyes of the Eagle
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Eyes%20of%20the%20Eagle.webp#right)  


These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.
