- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This gem has 3 charges. As an action, you can speak the gem's command word and expend 1 charge. For the next 10 minutes, you have [truesight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#truesight) out to 120 feet when you peer through the gem.

The gem regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn.
