# Feathered Helm
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/HWCS/Feathered-Helm.webp#right)  


The helm itself is simple leather, hide, scale, or plate, but the magic imbued into it comes from the feather. The birdfolk races of Humblewood consider the giving of a feather to be one of the highest honors one can bestow, and it represents an eternal bond or deep appreciation.

The helm has 3 charges that, while wearing it, you can use to activate its abilities. The helm has different properties based on the race of the birdfolk who gifted the feather.

## Corvum

You can use a charge to cast [Tasha's hideous laughter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tashas-hideous-laughter.md) (save DC 16) and two charges to cast [detect thoughts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-thoughts.md) (save DC 16).

## Gallus

You can use a charge to cast [bless](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/bless.md) and two charges to cast [aid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/aid.md).

## Luma

You can use a charge to cast a random 1st-level spell from the sorcerer spell list, then roll a `d20`. On a roll of 20, you may use this ability again without expending a charge. On a roll of 1, the spell also targets you, unless you are its only target, in which case the spell fizzles to no effect. Any spell cast using this helm that requires a saving throw has a save DC of 16.

## Raptor

You can use a charge to cast [hunter's mark](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hunters-mark.md) and two charges to cast [magic weapon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/magic-weapon.md).

## Strig

You can use a charge to cast [divine favor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/divine-favor.md) and two charges to cast [pass without trace](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/pass-without-trace.md).

The helm regains `1d3` charges each day at dawn.

> [!note] A True Gift
> 
> Whether you are playing through the Humblewood adventure, or playing your own campaign in the Wood, look for organic relationships between a character and the races of birdfolk. If one stands out, use that to decide what type of feather is offered to the player in this helm.
> 
> Additionally, a player whose character is a birdfolk may want to make this gift themselves. Make sure to create a narrative bond between this character and who they share a feather withâ€”the gift of a feather is not something which should be given lightly.
