# Goggles of Night
*Wondrous Item, minor, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Goggles%20of%20Night.webp#right)  


While wearing these dark lenses, you have [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision), wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.
