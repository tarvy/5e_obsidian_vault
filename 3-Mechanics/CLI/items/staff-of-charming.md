# Staff of Charming
*Staff, major, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Staff%20of%20Charming.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 charges to cast [charm person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/charm-person.md), [command](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/command.md), or [comprehend languages](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/comprehend-languages.md) from it using your spell save DC. The staff can also be used as a magic quarterstaff.

If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without the staff's intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.

The staff regains `1d8 + 2` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.
