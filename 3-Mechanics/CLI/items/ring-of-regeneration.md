# Ring of Regeneration
*Ring, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Ring%20of%20Regeneration.webp#right)  


While wearing this ring, you regain `1d6` hit points every 10 minutes, provided that you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after `1d6 + 1` days if you have at least 1 hit point the whole time.
