# Ring of Three Wishes
*Ring, major, legendary*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Ring%20of%20Three%20Wishes.webp#right)  


While wearing this ring, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 3 charges to cast the [wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell from it. The ring becomes nonmagical when you use the last charge.
