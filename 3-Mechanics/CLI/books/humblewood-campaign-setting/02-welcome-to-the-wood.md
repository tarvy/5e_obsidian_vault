# Welcome to the Wood
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting* 

the story begins

## Races of the Wood

all walks of life

The various folk who make up the world of Humblewood are divided into two categories: the birdfolk and the humblefolk. While they resemble animals, the folk who inhabit the cities, towns, and villages of Humblewood are all humanoids.

This chapter outlines the ten core races, five birdfolk and five humblefolk, who make up the majority of characters found in the Wood. It also details various character creation options, new class options, backgrounds, feats, and spells to help you make your own Humblewood adventurer.

### The Birdfolk
#birdfolk
The birdfolk races of Humblewood are as diverse and unique as the forest itself. Only the skillful survive the forest, and the birdfolk have become masters of both the forest floor and the canopies above, creating several settlements (known colloquially as "perches") throughout the Wood. Despite regional differences and cultural peculiarities among the different kinds of birdfolk in the Wood, the birdfolk races nevertheless share much of their culture, language, history, and origin myths. This solidarity has allowed them to work together and prosper, creating a harmony in the Wood which has lasted for an age.

While a diverse group, adapted for a variety of environments within the Wood, birdfolk also share several physical traits which have allowed them to find common ground in the construction of their perches. Beyond the obvious physical similarities, all birdfolk possess arms covered in feathers, which extend into wing-like appendages. While incapable of true powered flight, the strong hollow bones and lightweight bodies of birdfolk allow them to easily use their feathered arms to glide, and unless severely encumbered, all birdfolk can recover gracefully from what would otherwise be a deadly fall. In some birdfolk races these wings have grown strong enough to bear their owners upwards in a mighty flap, while others instead developed talons which make for both deadly defensive weapons and useful tools for scaling tall trees.

The birdfolk have established themselves as a political force to be reckoned with in Humblewood. They shaped their mighty capital from the great tree Alderheart, and from this bastion of safety their ruling body, the Birdfolk Council, makes decisions which impact all of Humblewood. The birdfolk are well-defended from outside threats thanks to the Perch Guard, a force of soldiers trained in both aerial and ground combat, that keeps their cities and the denizens within safe.

While Alderheart has been a beacon of peace and harmony for many years, the coming of the fires has thrown the region into chaos. The Perch Guard forces are spread thin across the canopy cities, barely able to secure the main roads for merchants while keeping their homes safe from the blazes. Now the great birdfolk cities face more threats from bandits and forest fires than ever before. Through it all, though, the birdfolk trust in solidarity, between themselves and the diverse groups of habitants who call their perches home, to weather the coming storm as they have so many times before.

### The Humblefolk
#humblefolk
Not all denizens of Humblewood are birdfolk. The term "humblefolk" is used throughout the Wood to refer to the non-birdfolk peoples who live a little closer to the forest floor. Unlike the birdfolk, whose shared language, histories, myths, and culture have allowed them to exist in harmony for most of Humblewood's history, the humblefolk represent a disparate group of peoples, cultures, and ways of seeing the world, many of whom haven't always seen eye to eye.

Ages ago, an accord was struck between the people of the forest floor to unite against roving bandits and quell the in-fighting that was wreaking havoc across the Wood. This accord was known as the "Humblefolk Treaty" and was witnessed by the birdfolk, who were just then beginning to shape the trunk of Alderheart. The birdfolk offered the humblefolk safety within their great city, and many accepted their offer. Over time, more and more humblefolk migrated to newly-established birdfolk perches, though many found birdfolk architecture to be restrictive for creatures without wings. In the same way, some groups of birdfolk, feeling too crowded within the booming perches, began to spread out and seek shelter within small woodland villages. Even today, the birdfolk who choose to live on the forest floor find themselves stigmatized, as a life in the canopy is considered proper in birdfolk society.

After the establishment of the treaty, humblefolk began to live once again in small woodland villages beneath the trees, although now in more diverse communities alongside some ground-dwelling birdfolk. With the expansion of the Humblefolk Treaty to allow humblefolk to call upon Perch Guard garrisons in times of crisis, and the birdfolk militias keeping the roads safe for merchant caravans, the Wood truly entered a golden age. Life for many humblefolk was peaceful and prosperous...until the fires came.

With the spreading flames, humblefolk villagers petitioned the overextended Perch Guard for aid, only to see help arrive too late, if at all. To make matters worse, after many years the divisions between the humblefolk communities have intensified: those who found prosperity in the birdfolk cities have adopted a perch-dweller's perspective, while those who live in the woodlands face a constant threat from brigands and forest fires. Others have even left to join the newly reformed Bandit Coalition, seeing not only a path for survival, but a chance to get even with the perch-dwelling birdfolk for broken oaths and unequal treatment. Yet, where the treaty holds, vibrant humblefolk communities can still be found. The humblefolk are resilient, and each race will devise a way to survive in this dangerous wood.

## Characters in the Wood

embodying one of the folk

This chapter outlines how you can customize your character, everything from physical characteristics, backgrounds, class options, feats, and spells, all in keeping with the flavor of Humblewood.

### Character Details

Your character is more than just a collection of rules. Here are a few tools to help you flesh out the look and feel of your character.

#### Sex & Gender

The sex or gender of a character doesn't confer any special bonuses or penalties. Playable races do not exhibit physical characteristics based on sex, and traits such as plumage, markings, and size difference are not associated with a specific sex or gender. The most significant variations in physical appearance come down to a character's subrace.

#### Height and Weight

The table below can be used to decide your character's height and weight. These are based on the information provided in each race's description, and reflect the natural variation that occurs within the different folk of the Wood.

To use this table, first locate your character's race, and roll for their height modifier. Add this result in inches to the base height shown in the previous column. Next, using the appropriate column, roll for your weight modifier. Some races have a flat weight modifier. If this is the case, simply use the number provided in this column. Then, take the number you rolled for the height modifier, and multiply it by the weight modifier. Add this result in pounds to your race's base weight.

You may notice that the weights for birdfolk races are significantly lower than for humblefolk of similar size. The birdfolk have hollow bones, reinforced by special internal structures that act as struts. Along with other weight-reducing adaptations, this allows birdfolk to glide. Birdfolk characters are not negatively impacted by their lower weight.

![Random Height and Weight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/random-height-and-weight-hwcs.md)

> [!note] Altering Race Size
> 
> The sizes listed in the racial descriptions represent suggested averages of the various races. Players can adjust these sizes depending on the kind of birdfolk or humblefolk character they'd like to play. Some varieties of strig, a race that takes their physical characteristics from owls, could be smaller sized, around 3 feet tall, if desired. Similarly, raptors, a race whose physical characteristics resemble birds of prey, could reach around 5 feet in height. For the sake of simplicity we advise that, regardless of the physical measurements of a character, they follow the size category rules of their race (Medium or Small). In the lore, this can be expressed by saying that even a small strig is solid and strong, where even a taller raptor is light and agile. This will make calculating things that rely on size categories much easier, rather than having to remember which size variant a player has chosen for a race.
> 
> Alternatively, if the races presented here are too big when placed in comparison to humans in other campaign settings, size categories can be adjusted accordingly. This is entirely a matter of taste. It is recommended to do whatever makes the most sense for the kinds of worlds you'd like to build and the kinds of stories you'd like to tell.

#### Variant Rule: Different Looks for Birdfolk and Humblefolk

The Wood covers a vast area of different environments. As such, birdfolk and humblefolk can showcase a variety of different forms. At the discretion of the GM, your Humblewood character may look different than other members of its race. While not exhaustive, we've provided examples of suitable analogs for different kinds of animals from which a playable race could take inspiration. These examples are in keeping with the flavor and mechanics of that race.

##### Cervan

Cervan characters could be imagined as elk, moose, or antelopes. Any hoofed creature with horns would fit the bill, especially those native to forest or mountainous environments. While not every cervan has horns, the ability to grow them is seen as a blessing of Cairith, and is a part of their culture.

##### Corvum

Birds which are known for their dark coloration, such as crows, blackbirds and grackles, would be a good visual fit. Despite typically being dark-feathered, a variety of colorful corvids exist. Jays, nutcrackers, and jackdaws are good examples.

No matter which type of bird is being used for visual inspiration for your corvum, it is important that they have at least one black feather. Black feathers on a corvum are known as the "Mark of Gesme" and they are thought to impart some of Gesme's reckless curiosity.

##### Gallus

Gallus characters are usually represented by land fowl of all kinds, ranging from those with small rounded bodies, suited to ground life, to those with longer proportions. Waterfowl, such as ducks or geese, could be used as visual inspiration for communities of gallus living by Humblewood's wetlands. Other fowl, such as peacocks, could also be used. While not closely-related to fowl, herons, storks, and bitterns could be a good reference for taller, marshland-dwelling communities of gallus.

Gallus characters with ostentatious, colorful plumage are generally better suited to the bright gallus subrace, while those with modest, earth-toned feathers might be better suited to the huden gallus subrace.

##### Hedge

While inspired by hedgehogs, having a hedge character based on a quilled animal that inhabits forests, such as a porcupine, would also make sense. Although they would probably not be native to Humblewood, armadillos, pangolins, or echidnas would also work.

##### Jerbeen

The jerbeens are inspired by jerboas, a kind of jumping mouse. Other small rodents with mouse-like proportions, including chinchillas, could be used for visual inspiration as well. Though a greater stretch, the jerbeen's speed, size, and communal way of life would make them an ideal analog for races based on rabbits or hares.

##### Luma

Lumas are inspired by doves and pigeons, but their size and high charisma means that small songbirds such as chickadees, wrens, sparrows, and cardinals would also be a good fit. A bird-of-paradise could be used as well due to their focus on performance, though they might be better suited for visitors to Humblewood from more tropical regions. Birds with brighter or more decorative plumage would correspond to sera lumas, while those with more muted feathers would be better as sable lumas.

##### Mapach

Inspired by raccoons, mapach characters can reference members of the weasel family, such as ferrets and badgers. Mapachs are hearty and crafty, and possess a climbing speed, which means many members of this family, including polecats, would be good fits.

##### Raptor

Raptors take after smaller birds of prey, like falcons and hawks, but using larger species, like eagles or vultures as a reference would also work for raptor characters. Maran raptors could also take visual inspiration from seabirds, notably petrels or shearwaters, due to their swim speed.

##### Strig

Strigs usually resemble owls of all kinds. Owls comprise a very large and diverse family of birds, and examples can be found which are small, large, or unique in appearance. For larger, more intimidating strigs, the great gray owl or giant scops owl can provide a robust presence, while smaller strigs could take inspiration from the little owl, or boreal owl. Regardless of their size, stout strigs tend to be bulkier, with denser feathers, while swift strigs have more slender and streamlined bodies.

##### Vulpin

Vulpins generally look like foxes, but an alternative visual reference would be wolves, coyotes, or other hunting canines that could be commonly found in a forest environment. Vulpins should be represented as wild animals, to illustrate the duality of their sophisticated yet savage nature. Breeds of tamed dogs would not be a good fit.

#### Languages of the Wood

Race determines the language your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional language of your choice. You are free to select these from among the languages offered in other 5e material, but there are several languages which are specific to the Wood.

The standard languages listed below are part of common life in Humblewood, and are spoken widely. Sylvan, along with various dialects of Primordial (Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran) are uncommon languages known only by few in the Wood, but they can prove exceptionally useful in communicating with the various fey and elemental Humblewood residents.

Each birdfolk race possesses a unique and mystical connection to the element of air, which allows them to understand Auran from birth, although they are unable to speak it naturally. Birdfolk who wish to become fluent in this dialect must take the time to learn. Because Auran is a dialect of Primordial, birdfolk innately understand Aquan, Ignan, and Terran as well, though not perfectly. Compared to Auran, the other dialects of Primordial sound stilted or broken to birdfolk. While they can understand simple concepts presented in these dialects, more complicated matters are lost in translation.

> [!note] Common and Birdfolk
> 
> Birdfolk takes the place of Common in Humblewood. As the language of trade and custom, folk of the Wood take the time to learn it. Other 5e races who choose to visit Humblewood will want to know Birdfolk. Likewise, birdfolk or humblefolk characters visiting other lands should add Common to their language list.
^common-and-birdfolk

![Languages of the Wood; Standard Languages](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/languages-of-the-wood-standard-languages-hwcs.md)

##### Birdfolk

Birdfolk is a language of clicks, caws, and whistles. Though primarily oral, a system for writing Birdfolk in pictograms was developed long before the founding of Alderheart and has since transformed into a set of abstract glyphs representing different sounds. Birdfolk can be written quickly with a quill, or scratched easily with a claw, and has been widely adopted throughout the Wood.

##### Cervan

Cervan is a complex language with no written script. It is seen as disrespectful to try and transcribe it using Birdfolk characters. Much of cervan history is preserved by village elders and passed down orally through the generations as stories, songs, and sayings. The adage, "What is essential to learn lies in the teaching", is often invoked to illustrate this point.

##### Hedge

Hedge is a language meant to be spoken softly. It confounds many who try to learn it due to the prevalence of passive voice and the deferential manners built into conversation. These are meant to ensure that everyone's feelings are heard and respected. It is written using a variation of Sylvan script.

##### Jerbeen

Jerbeen is a system of squeaks and clicks represented in writing by using a variant of Birdfolk alphabet. It is a polite but direct language designed to communicate information quickly and effectively between multiple listeners.

##### Mapach

Mapach is a very technically dense language that often incorporates rough equations and estimations of physical properties in normal conversation. Awareness of one's surroundings is key to survival, and the Mapach language emphasizes this. Mapach uses its own script of glyphs made of various lines, dashes, and dots.

##### Vulpin

Vulpin is a language of growls, snarls, and yips. It is written in its own flowing cursive script. Speakers are taught to switch between low and high class versions of Vulpin depending on the context. The biggest stumbling block for new speakers is learning when to use which form.

## New Class Options

pick your path

Here you will find a selection of options you can use to further customize your Bard, Cleric, or Fighter. The Cleric has access to two new domains: Night and Community, based on the Amaranthine of Humblewood. Bard and Fighter receive new class options which are well suited to characters from the Wood: The Scofflaw and The College of the Road. Scofflaws might find their talents useful among the Bandit Coalition, and bards from the College of the Road can be found sharing tales around campfires and hearths all across Humblewood.
