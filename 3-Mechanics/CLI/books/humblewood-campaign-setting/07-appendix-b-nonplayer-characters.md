# Appendix B: Nonplayer Characters

_Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting, p. 190_

friends and foes of the wood

You can use the NPC stat blocks presented here to create or alter encounters in Humblewood.

Some of the listed NPCs have been devised with certain birdfolk races in mind, and this is reflected in their stat blocks. Some are generic and could be used for any race of birdfolk. These can be used as is, but can also be further customized using the rules in "Appendix C: Creating NPCs" of this book.

Descriptions of the various NPCs which appear in Chapter 4: Adventure in the Wood can also be found here.

## Ardwyn, Elder of Meadowfen #NPC #HWAitW

A venerable huden gallus with rounded grouse-like proportions and feathers that have long since lost the sheen of youth. As the village Elder, Ardwyn is a figure of authority within Meadowfen. She and her late husband kept the village running until his death, after which she took on the role alone. Elder Ardwyn is a kind and perceptive woman who exudes leadership. The villagers look to her for guidance. Ardwyn uses the [priest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a huden gallus. She is neutral good.

## Birdfolk Dockmaster #NPC #HWAitW

It may be odd to see birdfolk working the docks and ships of Saltar's Port, but the sea is a way of life for some folk. Jobs in the seafaring industry are as lucrative as they are tough. For the birdfolk that choose to ply their trade on the water, life is about order and efficiency. One improperly stowed barrel or poorly lashed line can spell disaster on the sea. Dockmasters take their marine jobs very seriously.

## Birdfolk Farmer #NPC #HWAitW

Simple farmers can be found across the Wood, providing necessary food and supplies to the cities. There are many places in Humblewood where digging up large heaps of soil would either be impractical or damaging to the forest. While traditional farms exists in Humblewood, the majority of farms are built in the canopies in or around cities. Farming in the canopy consists of growing flowering moss gardens or fruit-bearing vines on the branches of perch trees. Canopy farms can also include the raising of large insects for food, or silkworms for clothing.

## Birdfolk Guard #NPC #HWAitW

Aspiring recruits from all over the Wood flock to the Perch Guard headquarters in the capital of Alderheart to join their ranks. After successful training, these newly sworn guards return to their home perch. They serve with pride, acting as the perch's first line of defense. Under the Humblefolk Treaty, members of the Perch Guard are tasked to aid nearby villages on the forest floor whenever necessary. In larger cities like Alderheart, the Perch Guard are also responsible for dealing with inner city issues such as robbery, bar fights, and investigating and arresting criminals.

> ![Birdfolk Guard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-guard-hwcs.md#^statblock)

## Birdfolk Militia #NPC #HWAitW

In smaller perches, where a guard force may be minimal or nonexistent, town security consists of a locally-organized militia. Anyone can enlist in these groups, provided they are upstanding citizens. They can be called upon by the Perch Guard to perform duties ranging from policing streets to supplementing military efforts.

> ![Birdfolk Militia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-militia-hwcs.md#^statblock)

### Cara Stormsinger #NPC #HWAitW

A tawny-feathered swift strig woman from Meadowfen, Cara is the captain of the village militia. She was responsible for assembling the team of villagers who went out to investigate the black plume of smoke that appeared over Meadowfen's horizon. She endured a harrowing journey to return home and relay Ashbarrow's fate to Elder Ardwynn. Cara uses the [birdfolk militia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-militia-hwcs.md) stat block adjusted with the racial traits of a swift strig. She is lawful good.

## Birdfolk Sailor #NPC #HWAitW

For birdfolk who take up the seafaring trade, their home is as much on the ocean as it is at port. They relish the salt spray and stiff winds, finding the closed spaces of forest life to be stifling compared to the wide-open expanse of the sea.

> [!embed-monster]- Birdfolk Sailor
> ![Birdfolk Sailor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-sailor-hwcs.md#^statblock)

> [!note] Peculiar Design
>
> Birdfolk ship design often causes confusion among other seafaring races due to the relative absence of rigging. While cordage is needed to keep sails in place and cargo stored, nets and climbing ropes prove less necessary when the crew is capable of limited flight. A birdfolk sailor can simply lash a rope to their leg, open their wings, and let the ocean breeze carry them up to the sails or to a lookout post on the main mast.
> ^peculiar-design

## Birdfolk Skirmisher #NPC #HWAitW

The bulk of the Perch Guard's military force are a light infantry called "The Spears." They train relentlessly with polearm weapons perfectly suited for branch-to-branch combat. Many are also skilled at ranged attacks with these weapons, as well as performing special diving maneuvers, making them an even greater threat to enemies below. In times of peace, skirmishers often serve as skilled hunters, following the direction of trackers to collect enough food for entire villages.

## Bita, the Council Speaker #NPC #HWAitW

Bita is a bright gallus whose elegant white plumage resem-bles that of a peacock. As the Birdfolk Council's Speaker, she is always first to address those who have been granted an audience with the Council. She takes her duties as the Speaker and as a Council member very seriously. Despite her profound affection for Humblewood and its citizens, she often comes off as severe and cold. Bita believes in doing what's best for the folks of the Wood, and sometimes this means making level-headed, tough decisions. Bita uses the [noble](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a bright gallus. She is lawful good.

## Cervan Bandit General #NPC #HWAitW

Bandit clans are commanded by generals. Serving as both a battle-tested warrior and master strategist, they alone coordinate the disparate band of thieves and outlaws that make up the collective. While military monikers are used to refer to bandit leadership, more than combat prowess is needed to maintain order in these volatile organizations. A dominating personality and charismatic voice are as necessary as a swift blade and a sharp mind. Cervans don't typically take to brigandry, but their practical skills and ability to survive in even the most adverse situations make those with loose morals and dubious ambitions a natural fit.

> ![Cervan Bandit General](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/cervan-bandit-general-hwcs.md#^statblock)

### Benna Seridan #NPC #HWAitW

Benna is a tall, scarred grove cervan, who wears a red bandana over her lost left eye. The leader of the Bandit Coalition, she is an idealist who believes that Alderheart's canopy, the symbol of birdfolk power in the region, should be burned and its resources looted to help those displaced by the flames. Benna lived a tranquil village life until her mother, a respected village elder and seer, foretold that the flames would come. Word was sent to Alderheart's Council, asking for supplies and aid, both of which were denied because the Council didn't believe in the power of the seer's visions. When the flames had all but consumed the village, birdfolk support arrived, but it was too late. Benna lost her family. She also lost her left eye and left ear due to the burns she sustained while helping others escape from the blaze. She fell in with the bandits and quickly rose through their ranks, thanks to her passion and purpose. She is a seasoned veteran who has been building the bandit forces, and utilizing the organization to care for humblefolk left homeless by the spreading fires. Benna Seridan uses the [cervan bandit general](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/cervan-bandit-general-hwcs.md) stat block, but the [scimitar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/scimitar.md) in her main hand is a [blade of the wood](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/blade-of-the-wood-hwcs.md) \*(+1 to attack and damage rolls, see "Appendix D: New Magic Items"), and a [shortsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shortsword.md) (`1d6 + 3` piercing damage) in her offhand.

## Cervan Priest #NPC #HWAitW

Cervan villages are typically led by a community elder who is wise both in politics as well as the ways of the Amaranthine. Priests provide guidance to the community, ensuring that rituals are properly observed and customs upheld. As storytellers and keepers of a village's history, they are trusted with the myths and folktales used to impart knowledge necessary for survival in the forest.

## Corvum Assassin #NPC #HWAitW

Frequently members of criminal organizations, contract killers can be found in the Wood's largest and most politically complex perches. They serve powerful figures with a lack of scruples and an abundance of coin. Assassins are trained from a young age to become deadly masters of their craft, learning how to skulk the branchroads and keep hidden in the canopy to time the perfect ambush. Corvums, with their natural intelligence and cunning, make the best assassins.

> [!embed-monster]- Corvum Assassin
> ![Corvum Assassin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/corvum-assassin-hwcs.md#^statblock)

## Corvum Diviner #NPC #HWAitW

Diviners specialize in esoteric spells and rituals, which can be used to see the threads of fate that move the world. Even when such predictions fail, they usually reveal useful information in the process. Corvums prize knowledge in all its forms, often dealing in secrets the way others deal in goods, and so many are drawn to practice the diviner's art.

> [!embed-monster]- Corvum Diviner
> ![Corvum Diviner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/corvum-diviner-hwcs.md#^statblock)

### Corvax Revayne #NPC #HWAitW

This slender dusk corvum's plumage resembles that of a black-billed magpie. A professor of divination at the Avium, his brilliant mind is often held back by paranoia, an unfortunate side-effect of the diviner's line of work. This has led faculty to view his predictions cautiously, and has earned him a reputation as a bit of an oddbird around campus. He is smart and capable, however, and can be a useful ally to the party in the last two parts of the adventure. Corvax shouldn't ever be in combat.

> [!embed-monster]- Corvax Revayne
> ![Corvax Revayne](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/corvax-revayne-hwcs.md#^statblock)

## Corvum Necromancer #NPC #HWAitW

Every sentient being is susceptible to the lure of necromancy. The promise of seeing lost loved ones again, or raising an army of powerful minions, can sometimes be difficult to resist. The birdfolk of Humblewood are not immune to that lure. To help curb this curiosity, professors at The Avium teach necromantic theory only. But some intrepid students have been known to pursue the practical applications in secret. Sure of their intellect, corvums in particular are often willing to challenge traditions for the sake of knowledge. As a result, more than one corvum has wandered down the path of the dark arts.

> [!embed-monster]- Corvum Necromancer
> ![Corvum Necromancer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/corvum-necromancer-hwcs.md#^statblock)

### Odwald Ebonhart #NPC #HWAitW

Odwald is a haggard old kindled corvum, resembling a thick billed raven with coarse, hoary feathers, ruffled from years of adventuring. Odwald has a sharp mind but a faint heart. A member of the illustrious Ebonhart family, a noble house that dates back to the founding of Alderheart, Odwald was an arcane prodigy who grew up in a world which expected him to be brilliant. While magic always came naturally to him, the pressure of his family's expectations weighed heavily upon him, and filled him with a deep-seated fear of failure. Months ago, he was tricked by an unknown entity into weakening the seal that held the aspect of fire beneath the Scorched Grove. Ever since he has blamed himself for the worsening conditions in the Wood. He has no solution for stopping the aspect, and this terrifies him. Shortly after saving his friend Riffin, desperation drove him back to his alma mater, the Avium, where he has since worked with forbidden magics in secrecy. Using a secret door he discovered during his time as a student, Odwald converted several inaccessible and defunct classrooms into a makeshift laboratory where he toils tirelessly, experimenting with dark and dangerous magics in the hopes of discovering a way to stop the aspect. Odwald uses the [corvum necromancer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/corvum-necromancer-hwcs.md) stat block. His alignment is chaotic neutral.

## Eliza Pennygleam #NPC #HWAitW

Eliza Pennygleam is an eluran, a group of cat-like people from the west. While not native to Humblewood, elurans are commonly seen along the roads as part of merchant caravans, and behind merchant stalls in the capital. Eliza is a savvy merchant, on her way to Alderheart to take over her late sister's shop. She is a natural bargainer, but she is also charitable to those who have faced hardships. Eliza uses the [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block. She is neutral good.

> [!embed-monster]- Eliza Pennygleam

## Figory Figgins #NPC #HWAitW

A slender, blond-furred jerbeen with an affable nature and an unfortunate reputation. Figory has been studying for two years at the Avium, but anxiety about the professors expectations and the complicated schedule needed for featherless students to navigate campus have held him back a full year compared to other students. He has been bullied by his classmates at the Avium, and his recent encounter with the cobblefright has left him deeply unnerved. He desperately wants someone to believe his story and take action against the creature lurking around campus. Figory uses the [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a jerbeen. He is neutral.

## Gallus Druid #NPC #HWAitW

The gallus of Humblewood have an especially deep connection with nature. Hanera teaches them to see the world from the forest floor, instead of the canopy. This is a message many gallus have taken to heart. Out of this reverence for nature, some gallus dedicate themselves to the study and preservation of the Wood, becoming wardens of the forest, or acting as guides. A select few with a unique connection to flora and fauna develop incredible powers and abilities. These druids can sprout trees and mend injured animals with a touch. They are revered among birdfolk and humblefolk alike as spiritual leaders and wise advisors.

> [!embed-monster]- Gallus Druid
> ![Gallus Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gallus-druid-hwcs.md#^statblock)

## Gallus Monk #NPC #HWAitW

Gallus who are not content to settle into everyday life in small communities venture out to secluded monasteries and learn the way of the monk. There, a disciplined routine of physical rigours and spiritual contemplation is overseen by wizened masters. After years of training, initiates are deemed ready to journey the land and put their learning to the test. The majority return to the monastery after having had a revelation during their travels. Other continue to wander, sometimes with a few trusted companions, forever finding new meaning.

> [!embed-monster]- Gallus Monk
> ![Gallus Monk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gallus-monk-hwcs.md#^statblock)

## Gallus Necromancer #NPC #HWAitW

Gallus aren't typically drawn down the path of necromancy, but a few mavericks with arcane talent and the inclination to study the darker side of magic have found success in The Avium. More commonly, such necromancers study the art theoretically, learning how it disrupts the balance of life and death so that their students can be taught how to effectively counter such vile spells.

> ![Gallus Necromancer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gallus-necromancer-hwcs.md#^statblock)

### Glinda Nightseed #NPC #HWAitW

This huden gallus' plumage resembles a ptarmigan, and she usually wears a pince-nez on her beak. A professor of advanced theoretical necromancy, Glinda is known for having strange opinions about her field of study. Unlike most birdfolk, she sees necromancy as a manipulation of life energies on par with druidic magic. She is a kind soul, and only practices the lighter forms of necromancy. However, she has been performing secret experiments on the servitor skeletons in the Avium, hoping to develop a cutting-edge resurrection spell. This violates campus policies, which ban practical necromancy, and could cause her to lose her job. Glinda uses the [gallus necromancer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gallus-necromancer-hwcs.md) stat block. Her alignment is chaotic good.

## Gregor Thornspur, Magistrate of Alderheart #NPC #HWAitW

Gregor is a dull-looking sable luma with a single errant feather that sticks out oddly from his brow. Gregor is the Magistrate of Alderheart, and though he appears to be a tired bureaucrat, his demeanour hides a shrewd businessman eager to turn any situation to his advantage. He is not above taking bribes in exchange for expediting requests to see the Birdfolk Council. Gregor uses the [noble](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of sable luma. He is chaotic neutral.

## Hedge Bard #NPC #HWAitW

Recognized for being excellent diplomats and mediators, hedges are less well known for their love of music. Those who turn their natural charm towards the talent of entertaining can find great success. Some of the most gifted performers are blessed with magical talents. While most hedges use these powers for good, others choose a more sinister path, using their bardic talents to cheat, dupe, or steal from common folk.

> [!embed-monster]- Hedge Bard
> ![Hedge Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hedge-bard-hwcs.md#^statblock)

## Hedge Witch #NPC #HWAitW

Many who apply to study at the Avium are turned away by the prestigious institution. Spurred by their desire for knowledge, rejected candidates sometimes start on a path to become self-taught masters of arcana. Notably in tune with the magic of the forest, hedges pursuing an individualistic path often leverage their connection to these natural forces to make pacts with powerful fey or elemental beings, learning secrets inaccessible to traditional students.

> [!embed-monster]- Hedge Witch
> ![Hedge Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hedge-witch-hwcs.md#^statblock)

### Susan of the Swamp #NPC #HWAitW

Susan is an eccentric hedge whose magical aptitude has always been outclassed by her hunger for knowledge. She studied at the Avium for a short time, but left of her own accord to experiment with magics the Avium found unsavory. Susan recently settled in the swamp in the hopes of pursuing her arcane curiosities in peace. She shares her modest home with her beetle familiar, Normal, and spends her time foraging for ingredients, testing spells, and reading mystery novels in addition to tomes of eldritch lore. Though she performs her rituals a safe distance away from the cities and towns, her presence in the region has made the Magistrate of Winnowing Reach uneasy, and he wants her gone. Susan uses the [hedge witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hedge-witch-hwcs.md) stat block. Her alignment is chaotic good.

## Jell Platena #NPC #HWAitW

Jell is a bespectacled sera luma with bright red plumage resembling a cardinal. Jell has studied at the Avium for three years now, and is well on her way to becoming a graduate. She is bright and studious, and serious about everything she does in life. Jell uses the [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a sera luma. She is neutral good.

## Jerbeen Thief #NPC #HWAitW

While criminals can often be found picking pockets in large perch cities, only the most successful end up recruited by the Bandit Coalition. Small of stature, jerbeens can easily move about unnoticed; their swiftness is responsible for the expression "quick as a jerbeen." This, coupled with their natural charm, makes jerbeens perfectly suited for the thieving arts.

> [!embed-monster]- Jerbeen Thief
> ![Jerbeen Thief](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-thief-hwcs.md#^statblock)

## Jerbeen Swashbuckler #NPC #HWAitW

A common figure in many jerbeen folktales, a swashbuckler is a champion who fights with finesse and daring. Natural leaders, swashbucklers keep their wits about them during a duel, pressing small advantages to win the day. Jerbeen swashbucklers often train in the tradition of their Amaranthine, Gaspard. Each year swashbucklers participate in fencing matches held in Gaspard's honor. Not all swashbucklers follow this path, with some using their talents for brigandry.

## Kenna Brightspark #NPC #HWAitW

An energetic and curious young dusk corvum scholar who is currently working on a dissertation in Winnowing Reach. Kenna's research focuses on the properties of various slimes around the region. She is a student of the Avium, and hopes her findings will earn her a grant to fund yet more study of these fascinating creatures. Kenna is a native of Winnowing Reach, and knows the village well. She is a little precocious and takes risks for her work. Kenna uses the [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a dusk corvum. She is chaotic good.

## Luma Cleric of Ardea #NPC #HWAitW

Clerics of Ardea travel the Wood on holy pilgrimages to sacred groves resplendent with life fostered by the Dawnmother. They spread Ardea's message of kindness wherever they go, taking it upon themselves to protect all life, great and small. Clerics serve the communities they pass through as healers, mediators, and occasionally as valiant defenders. Lumas who heed the call of the Amaranthine find their natural charisma and mystic talents to be of great help as they walk the cleric's path.

## Luma Wizard #NPC #HWAitW

It is widely believed among the birdfolk that only those with focused minds can master the subtle art of magic. For unknown reasons, perhaps their inherent connection to fate or particular manner of engaging with the world, lumas are able to tap into the mystical and magical forces with ease.

> [!embed-monster]- Luma Wizard

### Gabe Windsworth #NPC #HWAitW

Gabe is a middle-aged sable luma with a large plume of iridescent feathers that surround his nape like a cowl. The Dean of the Avium, Gabe always appears as though he is deep in thought. Though his amiability and kooky behavior cause people to underestimate him, beneath the quirky exterior lies a keen mind that carefully evaluates all possibilities before taking action. He is a good-natured scholar who is just as concerned with the wellbeing of his staff and students as he is with the quality of research and education within the Avium. Dean Windsworth uses the [luma wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/luma-wizard-hwcs.md) stat block. His alignment is neutral good.

## Mapach Bandit #NPC #HWAitW

Mapachs are particularly distrusted among birdfolk because of their eccentricities and willingness to break with commonly held customs. Often judged on sight to be crooked, some mapachs find it hard to integrate into birdfolk society and turn to crime to survive. Local bandit forces are happy to exploit this, offering the displaced mapachs shelter and a share of the spoils in exchange for their service.

> ![Mapach Bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md#^statblock)

## Mapach Brute #NPC #HWAitW

Although many in the bandit coalition follow noble ideals, there have always been a handful of unreliable members, only concerned with their own advancement. These ruthless brutes are scoundrels through and through, willing to seize power within the coalition by any means necessary. Mapachs don't have more knaves among them as a matter of course, but the infamy of a few such villains has further sullied their reputation in the eyes of perch-dwellers.

### Krall, the Scavenger King #NPC #HWAitW

Krall is an imposing mapach, standing nearly 6 feet tall with a solid build and matted fur that is missing in patches. He was close friends with Benna, although he didn't share her altruism and instead believed that those who couldn't carry their weight should be left behind. He expects complete loyalty from his followers, and favors hit-and-run tactics. He and his troops exact tolls on poorly-defended caravans for passage along the roads, which many pay to avoid his wrath. Krall uses the [mapach brute](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-brute-hwcs.md) stat block.

## Mapach Tinkerer #NPC #HWAitW

Unlike those who are content to stay within the boundaries of their established craft, tinkerers have a passion for innovation that is unfettered by tradition. Mapach craftspeople who constantly look for ways to improve upon past creations find themselves branded as eccentrics. Their methods are unconventional, but eminently practical. Designs are often carefully considered, and some of their innovations eventually find widespread use around the Wood.

## Mordane Swiftgale #NPC #HWAitW

Mordane is a prim-and-proper elderly swift strig, who keeps his gray and white feathers preened, and his librarian robes freshly pressed. He is wise but old fashioned, and prefers to read in solitude when off shift, rather than fraternize with his peers. Despite his social shortcomings, he's an experienced librarian, and has incredible knowledge of even the oldest parts of the lower library. Mordane uses the [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a swift strig. He is neutral.

## Oakheart #NPC #HWAitW

Oakheart is a huge tree-shaped creature with charred bark that smolders in places, and many small flames which burn on his branches, giving the impression of leaves. Once a treant, he bathed in the primal energies of the Scorched Grove, transforming into an entity so thoroughly possessed of the element of flame that he's capable of serving as [The Borealus'](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/borealus-hwcs.md) keeper. He is the artifact's guardian, and will not relinquish the staff until he has been convinced that whoever has disturbed him can control the staff's considerable power, and that they mean to maintain the natural balance he sacrificed himself to protect.

## Raptor Explorer #NPC #HWAitW

Whether drawn by tales of treasure or the allure of faraway lands, some residents of Humblewood journey to seek out distant ruins or remote vistas to satisfy their wanderlust. Explorers are common among raptors, many of whom do so out of veneration for the Amaranthine Reya, the guide and protector of travelers. Numerous explorers embark on such adventures for the sake of self-discovery and personal growth. Those who have made a life out of exploring often find their service as guides in high demand.

## Rhys Birchwalker #NPC #HWAitW

An associate professor of conjuration at the Avium, this middle-aged mistral raptor has little in the way of mystic talent, but she makes up for it with an enthusiasm for learning and a wealth of knowledge on her chosen subject. She is well-versed in conjuratory theory, and can provide characters with any of the information they would otherwise find in **Conjuration Magic** (see Into the Library) if she is asked about the subject directly. Professor Birchwalker can also help a character perform the calculations to find the location of the conjuration circle within the Grove. Rhys uses the [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a mistral raptor. She is neutral good.

## Strig Knight #NPC #HWAitW

### Riffin, the Ash-Knight #NPC #HWAitW

Riffin is a small stout strig, standing a few inches over three feet, whose plumage and proportions resemble a little owl. A traveling knight of the realm, Riffin lived in Ashbarrow before its destruction, and was carried to Alderheart by his friend Odwald, who saved him from the fire. Being one of the only knights to hail from Ashbarrow, folk began calling him the "Ash-Knight," a title which he now uses to keep the memory of his home alive. Riffin is a simple strig with a charming way of viewing the world. He is also a steadfast warrior who strongly believes in doing what is right, helping those in need, and honoring his debts. Riffin uses the [strig knight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/strig-knight-hwcs.md) stat block. His alignment is lawful good.

## Strig Tracker #NPC #HWAitW

Capable of moving swiftly through the wilderness, trackers help find those who have lost their way in the forest. Accomplished survivalists, they are familiar with hidden pathways throughout the Wood. Often found alongside woodland beasts, many have formed bonds with these creatures, and find their aid useful in locating lost travelers. For Strigs, known for being at ease even in the harshest environments, becoming a tracker can prove a satisfying challenge. Some use their skills to double as bounty hunters, which can provide for an even more thrilling chase.

## The Tenders #NPC #HWAitW

Although the Tenders are most well known across the Wood for their involvement in healing and studying the Scorched Grove, their order is actually far more ancient. Wardens of nature, they use their gentle magics to mediate between the people of the Wood and the living forest itself, and to help the forest heal from natural disasters. Today, many of their members find employ as tree-shapers, and are well-respected in birdfolk settlements. Nowhere is this more true than in Alderheart, where the Tenders are looked upon favorably for the work they've done to create and strengthen living spaces within Alderheart's trunk. Other factions of Tenders work to respond to forest fires across the Wood, using their magic to encourage new growth in burned areas, as well as to help any survivors.

Since the Great Calamity, a large part of their order has dedicated their efforts to tending the Grove, monitoring its spread, and studying the mysterious creatures that live there. Unfortunately, much of the healing in the Grove can end up ruined by a sudden blaze. Progress has been made, however. Before the fires started to rage with renewed force, the Tenders managed to shrink the Grove little by little, doing much to bolster the forest that grows around its edges.

The Tenders are a unique organization in birdfolk society. Gaining admission to their ranks is akin to joining a monastery or convent. After initiation, a novice is generally expected to make their way to the Scorched Grove to learn from the masters who live there. Recruits live and study communally in special shelters within the Grove, protected by Tender magic. When they are sent out in the world again, new acolytes are taught to leave the high cities and walk among the under-growth, to gain a better perspective on forest life. On occasion, Tenders living in the Wood will go on pilgrimages to tend to the Grove before returning to their normal duties. Masters of the order often choose to completely dedicate themselves to healing the Grove, setting up permanent homes there. This is considered to be a noble self-sacrifice among Tenders, and those who do this are given the order's highest honors.

> [!note] Joining the Tenders

> Gaining admission to the ranks of the Tenders is not difficult, and recruits are especially welcome now to help expand their thinning numbers. Any player who shows proper devotion to the tenets of natural balance and a willingness to swear an oath to become a keeper of the Wood can speak with Havel of the Autumn Moon about joining the Tenders. New recruits will begin at the Seedling rank.

> Joining the Tenders involves taking an oath to keep the balance of nature, to help it recover from disasters both natural and unnatural, and to help all people who have been harmed by natural imbalance. The Tenders know they can't control nature, and they teach that trying to do so is a folly which will only lead to further unbalancing of natural cycles. They do believe that when disaster strikes, it is their duty to restore the balance that was lost for the sake of all beings.

### Havel of the Autumn Moon #NPC #HWAitW

Havel is a frail but courageous huden gallus, with pheasant-like plumage. He is a dear friend of Tevor, and the two have fallen for each other during their time together in Alderheart. Havel is a Summerblossom, a rank given to experienced members of the Tenders. He has been working at the Tenders' headquarters in the Trunk district, where he provides aid to the refugees. He is also skilled in the use of natural magic, and while normally too sickly to adventure, could still assist the party with his talents.

### Tevor of the Spring Path #NPC #HWAitW

Tevor is a timid sable luma, with ruddy gray feathers and a short beak. He is a good friend of Havel, and has begun to feel affection for the gallus since their time working together. Tevor is a Sapling, a low ranking member of the Tenders, who barely escaped from an ashsnake attack that killed his mentor. While he has agreed to give his report of events in the Scorched Grove, he is not prepared to do much beyond this. He possesses conviction in the beliefs of his order, but the traumatic event has left him feeling frightened and helpless. If only he could find the courage to match his ideals, he would be destined for greatness. Tevor is generally averse to combat now, but before joining the Tenders he trained as a perch guard recruit.

## Vulpin Captain #NPC #HWAitW

Captains are respected among the bandit forces, leading units on raids and ambushes, and sometimes running the operations of an entire camp. While captains are among the more skilled warriors in the coalition, involvement with day-to-day operations grants them a certain rapport with even the low-ranking bandits. This leadership, coupled with their prowess, allows them to rally or kowtow those foolish enough to consider desertion. Vulpins, with their natural ambition, cunning, and force of personality, can readily be found climbing to the rank of captain.

She is astute and talented, but also competitive and unwilling to forget even the smallest slight against her.

## Vulpin Priest of Kren #NPC #HWAitW

Priests of the Amaranthine Kren tend shrines in her honor, and share stories of her guile and cunning with visitors. These tales emphasize humility, wariness, and teach listeners to keep their wits about them at all times. In rare cases, these priests are given divine gifts by their Amaranthine. Conferred a portion of Kren's supernatural slyness, they often seek to humble those who have grown too proud.

He will not break his bargains, and likewise won't tolerate anything on the party's part which could be conceived as oath-breaking, dishonesty, or actions that might bring harm to the Reach. He cares deeply for his citizens, but that sometimes fails to come across as his political ambitions tend to get in the way. Walden has known Kenna Brightspark since she was but a fledgeling. Walden uses the [noble](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a kindled corvum. He is lawful neutral.
