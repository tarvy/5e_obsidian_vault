To adjust an existing NPC or build one from scratch, follow these steps to create birdfolk or humblefolk NPCs to use in your own adventures.

## Birdfolk NPCs

Turn any NPC into a birdfolk by making the following changes to its base stat block. These rules can be used to further customize the generic birdfolk NPCs included in this book.

Birdfolk are Medium sized and use the base speed of the NPC unless otherwise specified.

### Glide

All birdfolk have feathered arms capable of gliding short distances and slowing their fall speed. Add the Glide trait to the NPC. Ignore heavy armor in this glide. Birdfolk NPCs with heavy weapons, armor, or shields in their stat block should be able to glide with them.

### Feathers vs. Talons

If your creature is a **gallus** or **luma**, they have much more developed wings. They have the Wing Flap trait, an ability that can propel them upwards into the air at up to half their base movement speed. This costs a bonus action to use, and cannot be used to gain height while gliding.

If your creature is a **corvum**, **raptor** or **strig**, they have taloned hands. Make sure to add Talons to their attacks, and calculate attack and damage bonuses for it using either Strength or Dexterity. The base damage for these attacks is `1d4` piercing damage. Birdfolk with Talons also have advantage on Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks made to climb.

### Languages

Birdfolk all speak Birdfolk. They can also naturally understand Auran, the elemental language of air, but they have no innate ability to speak it.

### Racial Abilities

Every birdfolk race has two subraces, and each subrace possesses a different set of abilities.

## Corvum

Desperate for knowledge as a means of power, corvums are usually found in positions of power or influence. Their quest for power leads many to become warlocks or assassins.

### Ability Modifiers

+2 to the base creature's Intelligence score.

### Learned

A corvum gains proficiency in one of the following skills: [Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana), [History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History), [Nature](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature), or [Religion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion).

- Then, add abilities from a corvum subrace.  

### Dusk Corvum

+1 to the base creature's Dexterity score.

#### Skulker

The dusk corvum has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made in dim light or darkness.

#### Convincing

The kindled corvum gains proficiency in your choice of the [Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) skill. Additionally, they have advantage on all Charisma checks used to convince someone of their knowledge of anything pertaining to the skill they gained proficiency in from their Learned ability.

Pronghorn cervans have a set of large, strong antlers that can be used to make melee attacks. Their antler attack deals `1d6` piercing damage and is calculated using the creature's strength score for the purposes of determining the attack roll and damage bonus.

- Choose one of the following:  

### Robust Build

Double the pronghorn cervan's carrying capacity as well as the weight they can push, drag, or lift.

### Charge

If the pronghorn cervan moves at least 20 feet in a straight line towards an enemy, their Antler attack deals an extra `1d6` points of piercing damage. If the target of the charge is Large or smaller, they must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of the pronghorn cervan's Proficiency Bonus + 8 + the pronghorn's Strength modifier. On failure, the target is pushed 10 feet away from the pronghorn cervan.

Any creature that misses the hedge with a melee attack while they are curled up takes `2d4` points of piercing damage from the sharp quills. If a creature hits the hedge while they are curled up, however, the hedge is knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) in their space at the end of the turn. The hedge may uncurl themselves at any point during their turn.
