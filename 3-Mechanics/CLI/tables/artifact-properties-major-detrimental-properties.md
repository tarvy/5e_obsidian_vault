**Major Detrimental Properties**

`dice: [](artifact-properties-major-detrimental-properties.md#^major-detrimental-properties)`

| dice: d100 | Property |
|------------|----------|
| 01-05 | While you are attuned to the artifact, your body rots over the course of four days, after which the rotting stops. You lose your hair by the end of day 1, finger tips and toe tips by the end of day 2, lips and nose by the end of day 3, and ears by the end of day 4. A [regenerate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/regenerate.md) spell restores lost body parts. |
| 06-10 | While you are attuned to the artifact, you determine your alignment daily at dawn by rolling a `d6` twice. On the first roll, a 1-2 indicates lawful, 3-4 neutral, and 5-6 chaotic. On the second roll, a 1-2 indicates good, 3-4 neutral, and 5-6 evil. |
| 11-15 | When you first attune to the artifact, it gives you a quest determined by the DM. You must complete this quest as if affected by the [geas](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/geas.md) spell. Once you complete the quest, you are no longer affected by this property. |
| 16-20 | The artifact houses a bodiless life force that is hostile toward you. Each time you use an action to use one of the artifact's properties, there is a 50% chance chance that the life force tries to leave the artifact and enter your body. If you fail a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, it succeeds, and you become an NPC under the DM's control until the intruding life force is banished using magic such as the [dispel evil and good](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md) spell. |
| 21-25 | Creatures with a challenge rating of 0, as well as plants that aren't creatures, drop to 0 hit points when within 10 feet of the artifact. |
| 26-30 | The artifact imprisons a [death slaad](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/death-slaad.md) (see the Monster Manual). Each time you use one of the artifact's properties as an action, the slaad has a 10% chance chance of escaping, whereupon it appears within 15 feet of you and attacks you. |
| 31-35 | While you are attuned to the artifact, creatures of a particular type other than humanoid (as chosen by the DM) are always hostile toward you. |
| 36-40 | The artifact dilutes magic potions within 10 feet of it, rendering them nonmagical. |
| 41-45 | The artifact erases magic scrolls within 10 feet of it, rendering them nonmagical. |
| 46-50 | Before using one of the artifact's properties as an action, you must use a bonus action to draw blood, either from yourself or from a willing or incapacitated creature within your reach, using a piercing or slashing melee weapon. The subject takes `1d4` damage of the appropriate type. |
| 51-60 | When you become attuned to the artifact, you gain a form of "long-term madness" (see chapter 8, "Running the Game"). |
| 61-65 | You take `4d10` psychic damage when you become attuned to the artifact. |
| 66-70 | You take `8d10` psychic damage when you become attuned to the artifact. |
| 71-75 | Before you can become attuned to the artifact, you must kill a creature of your alignment. |
| 76-80 | When you become attuned to the artifact, one of your ability scores is reduced by 2 at random. A [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell restores the ability to normal. |
| 81-85 | Each time you become attuned to the artifact, you age `3d10` years. You must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or die from the shock. If you die, you are instantly transformed into a [wight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/wight.md) (see the Monster Manual) under the DM's control that is sworn to protect the artifact. |
| 86-90 | While attuned to the artifact, you lose the ability to speak. |
| 91-95 | While attuned to the artifact, you have vulnerability to all damage. |
| 96-00 | When you become attuned to the artifact, there is a 10% chance chance that you attract the attention of a god that sends an avatar to wrest the artifact from you. The avatar has the same alignment as its creator and the statistics of an [empyrean](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/empyrean.md) (see the Monster Manual). Once it obtains the artifact, the avatar vanishes. |
