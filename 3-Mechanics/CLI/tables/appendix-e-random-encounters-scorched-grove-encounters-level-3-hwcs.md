**Scorched Grove Encounters (Level 3)**

`dice: [](appendix-e-random-encounters-scorched-grove-encounters-level-3-hwcs.md#^scorched-grove-encounters-level-3)`

| dice: d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | `1d4 + 1` [swarms of emberbats](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-emberbats-hwcs.md) attack. |
| 2 | An [ashsnake](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/ashsnake-hwcs.md) attacks. If the party is hunting for the ashsnake in Part 3, it is waiting to ambush them. |
| 3 | The party finds a small stand of scorched trees, two of which tower above the others. When approached these two [awakened trees](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/awakened-tree.md) attack with branches that glow with embers. Their attacks deal fire damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and can set flammable objects carried by characters on fire. |
| 4 | One [fire elemental](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental.md) can be seen off in the distance. Players must make a DC 10 Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check to avoid its notice, otherwise it will see them and attack.  |
| 5 | `1d3` [magma mephits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/magma-mephit.md) and `1d2` [dust mephits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/dust-mephit.md) attack. |
| 6 | `1d4` [magmin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/magmin.md) attack. |
| 7 | A Tender is being attacked by a [swarm of emberbats](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-emberbats-hwcs.md). |
| 8 | A field of geysers lays ahead, each intermittently spraying scalding gases into the air. The party can attempt to cross cautiously with a DC 16 Intelligence check to notice a pattern, or by making three DC 14 Dexterity saving throws, taking 4 (`1d8`) fire damage on each failure. Pass or fail, after 3 saving throws they've made it across. Alternatively, party members can choose to go around. If so, roll again on this table. |
