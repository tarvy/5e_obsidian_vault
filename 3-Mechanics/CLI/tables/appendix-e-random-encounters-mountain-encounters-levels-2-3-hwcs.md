**Mountain Encounters (Levels 2-3)**

`dice: [](appendix-e-random-encounters-mountain-encounters-levels-2-3-hwcs.md#^mountain-encounters-levels-2-3)`

| dice: d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Two [griffons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.md) can be seen in the distance. They give a warning shriek. The party can find another route, losing ground and rolling again on this table, or fight them. |
| 2 | `1d4` [mapach bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md) and a [vulpin captain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vulpin-captain-hwcs.md) attack. |
| 3 | A hungry [basilisk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/basilisk.md) appears. |
| 4 | `1d4` [jerbeen thieves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-thief-hwcs.md) attack. |
| 5 | `1d4` [mountain lions](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/mountain-lion-hwcs.md) attack. |
| 6 | The weather suddenly shifts to a bitter storm. If the party chooses not to take shelter, they must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw while traveling, suffering a level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) from the cold on a failure. |
| 7 | The party finds a weathered shrine to Altus. The first character that stops to pray here gains the ability to cast [enhance ability](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/enhance-ability.md) once, without using material components. The player may only select either the **Bear's Endurance** or **Bull's Strength** options when the spell is cast. |
| 8 | The party finds a roost of `1d3` [giant eagles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-eagle.md) with `1d4` young (Medium sized beasts that cannot attack) with them. They will attack unless the party can convince them they are not a threat. |
