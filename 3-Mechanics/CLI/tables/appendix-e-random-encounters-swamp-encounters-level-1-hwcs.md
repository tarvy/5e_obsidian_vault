| dice: d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | `1d3` [birdfolk skeletons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/birdfolk-skeleton-hwcs.md), covered in moss rise from the murky water and attack. |
| 2 | Two [sticky slimes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/sticky-slime-hwcs.md) and a [caustic slime](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/caustic-slime-hwcs.md) attack. |
| 3 | The party stumbles upon a [swarm of quippers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-quippers.md) in the water. Players with a passive Perception of 15 or higher notice the swarm and avoid it. |
| 4 | The party finds a fungus covered shrine to Henwin within a tangle of plant life. The first character to pray here gains the ability to cast [spiny shield](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/spiny-shield-hwcs.md) once, without using material components. |
| 5 | `1d4` [sticky slimes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/sticky-slime-hwcs.md) attack. |
| 6 | `1d2` [swarms of insects](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-insects.md) envelop the party. They have a walking speed of 5 ft., a 30 ft. flying speed, and no climbing speed. |
| 7 | Two [caustic slimes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/caustic-slime-hwcs.md) attack. |
| 8 | A birdfolk researcher caught in quicksand. Requires a DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to free. Roll again on this table to complicate the encounter. |
