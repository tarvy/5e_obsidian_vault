`dice: [](appendix-e-random-encounters-city-encounters-levels-2-4-hwcs.md#^city-encounters-levels-2-4)`

| dice: d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A [mapach tinkerer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-tinkerer-hwcs.md) with a hand cart of goods distracts the party with his marvelous wares while his [hedge bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hedge-bard-hwcs.md) partner attempts to pickpocket them. |
| 2 | An innocent [cervan priest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/cervan-priest-hwcs.md) is accosted by `1d4` [birdfolk guards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-guard-hwcs.md). These birdfolk are criminals who've stolen Perch Guard uniforms, and the party will be rewarded for their capture. |
| 3 | A visiting [vulpin noble](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vulpin-noble-hwcs.md) is interested in seeing the sights. Show them around town by rolling again on this table. They will accompany the party for this encounter, and should they survive, will reward the party 20 gp for the invigorating time. |
| 4 | A gathering of acrobatic street performers. If high enough level, a party member with the Sharp Mind trait, or who makes a DC 14 Intelligence check, will recognize a [gallus monk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gallus-monk-hwcs.md) among them from a wanted poster. |
| 5 | A citywide parade to honor Gaspard, the Champion. There are jousts, fencing matches, and other contests in which the party can participate. Defeat a [jerbeen swashbuckler](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-swashbuckler-hwcs.md) in a duel to win a magic item. |
| 6 | A mysterious death. If players are high enough level, this could lead to a fight with the [corvum assassin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/corvum-assassin-hwcs.md) who was paid to perform the murder. |
| 7 | A bar fight breaks out between `1d4` [mapach bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md) patrons and `1d4` [birdfolk militia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-militia-hwcs.md). |
| 8 | A pair of [jerbeen thieves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-thief-hwcs.md) steal from the party. This leads back to their [vulpin captain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vulpin-captain-hwcs.md) leader, who runs a pickpocketing ring in town. |
