**Forest Encounters (Level 1-2)**

`dice: [](appendix-e-random-encounters-forest-encounters-level-1-2-hwcs.md#^forest-encounters-level-1-2)`

| dice: d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | `2d4` [mapach bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md) ambush the party. |
| 2 | `1d2` [swarms of emberbats](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-emberbats-hwcs.md) attack the party. |
| 3 | `1d4` [magmin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/magmin.md) can be spotted burning foliage through the trees. They haven't started a fire yet, but they will if left unchecked. |
| 4 | The party finds a moss covered shrine to Reya. The first character that stops to pray here gains the ability to cast [elevated sight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/elevated-sight-hwcs.md) once. |
| 5 | `1d4` [mapach bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md) and a [jerbeen thief](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-thief-hwcs.md) spring from the forest, offering safe passage for a road toll of 3 gp per party member. They will attack if the toll is not paid immediately. |
| 6 | `1d3` [wolves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/wolf.md) led by a [dire wolf](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/dire-wolf.md) attack the party. |
| 7 | A [birdfolk skirmisher](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-skirmisher-hwcs.md) on patrol is struggling in a large spider web and calling for help. He has been bound in silk, requiring a DC 15 Strength check or one round using a cutting tool to free him. There are `1d2 + 1` [giant spiders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) hidden in the trees. |
| 8 | A bandit's net trap has been laid across the trail and covered with leaves. It can be spotted with a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. If players walk into it, the trap springs, and players must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to avoid getting caught. On a failure, you can roll on this table again to complicate the encounter. |
