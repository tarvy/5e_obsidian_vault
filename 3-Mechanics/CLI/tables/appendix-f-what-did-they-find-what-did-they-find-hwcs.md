| dice: d20 | They find... |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | A carefully cleaned and varnished mouse skull. |
| 2 | A ruby statue worth 50 gp, but birdfolk and humblefolk alike believe it to be cursed. |
| 3 | A golden coin dating back to the very founding of Alderheart. |
| 4 | A small switch-knife hidden inside of a wooden spoon. |
| 5 | A holy symbol of an Amaranthine not worshiped in Humblewood. |
| 6 | A feather with brilliant tropical colors, not seen on any Humblewood birdfolk. |
| 7 | A ring with a strange seed where a gemstone would normally be. |
| 8 | A mechanical cricket, but its winding key is missing. |
| 9 | A thin length of chain, that when examined is actually made of seamless loops of wood. |
| 10 | A small bag containing hand polished marbles, each one with a different small insect in it. |

| 12 | A wooden frog that is perpetually slick with some kind of viscous moisture. |
| 13 | A short, thin twig that is unbendable and indestructible. |
| 14 | A locket made from a polished periwinkle shell. A strange sigil has been carved on the inside. |
| 15 | A glass jar filled with eight fireflies, each giving off light. One glows white, and the others glow a different color of the rainbow. |
| 16 | A bandit mask from a time before the Coalition. |
| 17 | A detailed onyx carving of a birdfolk skull. It is cold to the touch. |
| 18 | A silver pinecone that is completely immune to fire damage. |
| 19 | A locked music box. Mechanical chirping can occasionally be heard from inside. |
| 20 | A weathered parchment scroll, which unfurls to reveal music inscribed in long-faded ink. |
