`dice: [](appendix-e-random-encounters-coast-encounters-level-4-hwcs.md#^coast-encounters-level-4)`

| dice: d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The party finds a small shrine to Gesme within a hidden grotto. The first player to pray here gains the ability to cast [clairvoyance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/clairvoyance.md) once, without material components. |
| 2 | 2 [raptor explorers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/raptor-explorer-hwcs.md) are leading a [strig tracker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/strig-tracker-hwcs.md) bounty hunter to the party. |
| 3 | `1d4` giant petrels circle overhead (use the stat block for a [giant eagle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-eagle.md), but with a 30 ft. swim speed). |
| 4 | A violent storm rolls in. If the party chooses not to take shelter, they must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw while traveling, suffering a level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) on a failure. |
| 5 | A mass of seaweed turns out to be a [shambling mound](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/shambling-mound.md). |
| 6 | A ship is stolen from the docks by `1d4 + 1` [birdfolk sailor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-sailor-hwcs.md) pirates, led by a [jerbeen swashbuckler](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-swashbuckler-hwcs.md). |
| 7 | A sinking ship is spotted with its crew aboard. There are `1d3` [hunter sharks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/hunter-shark.md) circling in the water. |
| 8 | A crashing wave sweeps in, and the party must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be swept 80 feet into the sea, where a [water elemental](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) lies in wait. |
