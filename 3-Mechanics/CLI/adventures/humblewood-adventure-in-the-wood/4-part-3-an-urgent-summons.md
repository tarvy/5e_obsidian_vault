# Part 3: An Urgent Summons
*Source: Humblewood: Adventure in the Wood, p. 123* 

the burning one wakes

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/adventure/HWAitW/Part-3.webp#center)

With the Council agreeing to aid Meadowfen, and the bandit forces dealt with, the Wood is enjoying relative peace. The party is free to engage in some downtime activities. Just remember that there may be a need to increase the challenge of the encounters listed here if the party reaches level 4 before this part of the adventure.

In this part of the story, the party will receive an urgent summons from the Council in Alderheart, who will explain that a huge creature, about which little is known, has been spotted burrowing under the ashen fields of the Scorched Grove. This is an [ashsnake](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/ashsnake-hwcs.md), one of many new fire-aspected creatures never before encountered in Humblewood. It was brought to life as a manifestation of the great [aspect of fire's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/aspect-of-fire-hwcs.md) rage.

The aspect of fire has been stirring more and more since its slumber was first disturbed, and fires began ravaging the Wood. The appearance of these elemental monstrosities signals that the aspect is close to fully awakening. Worse still, the ashsnake roaming the Scorched Grove has started to make things dangerous for the Tenders.

Having seen the party's prowess handling the bandits, the Council has sent for them to help put an end to this strange creature. It has become clear to both the Council and the Tenders that whatever has been happening in Humblewood of late has its roots in the Scorched Grove. For the good of the realm, the party will need to go investigate.

## The Tenders

The Tenders (see "Appendix B") have been badly affected by the recent events in the Wood. The frequency of the fires has their organization spread thin across the forest, and the few who remain to tend the Scorched Grove itself are overwhelmed by an increase in the activity of the creatures that live there.

As the Grove has continued to spread via fires, new and disturbing reports have poured in from Tender outposts. Enormous clouds of emberbats have been seen great distances away from the Grove, and several strange creatures have manifested through the power of elemental flame in this region. Many Tenders have already lost their lives to the monstrous threats.

> [!note] Council Summons
> 
> If the party is in Alderheart, a frantic Council aide will come to find them and deliver an emergency Council summons. The official-looking letter asks the characters to appear before the Council as soon as they are able.
> 
> If the characters are currently at another location in the Wood, a tracker from Alderheart may come to call on them or deliver the urgent summons. In either case, have the date of the summons set for the next day, or the day after characters arrive in the city to give them a chance to explore.
^council-summons

## Return to Alderheart

Whether or not this is actually a return depends on where characters spent their downtime: in Alderheart or elsewhere. Characters in the city are free to see the sights.

Eliza's Emporium, still owned and operated by the party's favorite eluran, will be turning a good profit and might have some new wares available at your discretion.

[Susan of the Swamp](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/susan-of-the-swamp-hwcs.md) is now here! She has assembled a small tent of wares in the Trunk Market, which she hopes to sell along with fortune readings. If a character wants their fortune read, it will cost a single gold piece. After taking a drop of their blood and consulting her cauldron, Susan will offer cryptic visions of a character's future. Either ad lib these or prepare them ahead of time to suit the game and the characters.

Susan will still offer to make potions in exchange for reagents (see A Witch's Debt), but she'll also sell a few prepared potions to fund her ongoing arcane research. Each of her potions costs 50 gp, except for [potions of superior healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-superior-healing.md) and [potions of resistance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-resistance.md), which each cost 100 gp. To decide how many of each potion she has in stock, roll randomly. Use a `1d4` to determine the quantity of any potion that cost 50 gp, and a `1d2` to determine the quantity of any potion that costs 100 gp.

### Future of the Coalition

Alderheart will have changed since the character's foray into the Bandit Stronghold, in ways that reflect the party's choices. Below are the two most common ways this could play out, but details can be modified based on how players decided to deal with the events of Part 2: The Bandit Menace.

***If Benna was reasoned with,*** the party will see a new uniformed force around Alderheart: the Wildwood Brigade, into which the Bandit Coalition has begun to successfully transition. They specialize in quickly mobilizing across parts of the Wood the Perch Guard have trouble reaching. They have already been of great help in extinguishing fires before remote villages can be destroyed, and delivering supplies and aid to villages damaged by blazes. Many members are humblefolk, former refugees who use their knowledge of pathways under the forest canopy to get where they're needed in a short time.

The bandit stronghold in the Crest has been converted into a supply depot and fallback point for the wounded. A new headquarters is also under construction in the Canopy, near the Perch Guard's headquarters. Characters may even find Benna, or whoever was appointed the Brigade's leader, working out of a temporary office in the Canopy district. They're busy overseeing operations for the Brigade, receiving intel from the ground, and mobilizing help where it's needed. The work is challenging, and word is coming in that the situation with the fires just keeps getting worse.

The Council chambers will now not only have the flags of the different birdfolk perches adorning it, but also several flags of the larger humblefolk settlements in the Wood. The humblefolk delegate selections for the Humblewood Council are ongoing. Many prominent figures have arisen in the political scene and are becoming more engaged in Council matters, hoping to win their own seat.

***If Benna was killed,*** with the defeat of their leader and the capture of their fortress, the Bandit Coalition has been broken in Humblewood, making for easier travel across the roads and an increase in the Perch Guard's ability to send aid to those affected by fires. Maintaining supply routes is still a strain however, and rumor has it conditions for humblefolk aren't much better.

Refugees still crowd the trunk market, and more are sneaking up into the city through secret knotholes, or making their way down to the roots where there is more space. Crime is becoming a real problem in Alderheart, and while the situation is not immediately noticeable in the canopy, even relatively affluent areas in the trunk show increased Perch Guard presence and increased fear of thievery among the populace. Locals lock their doors at night, and some have begun to arm themselves, fearing the need to defend their livelihoods. Merchants are especially vocal about this, and many can be found waiting for an audience outside the Council chambers.

## Trouble with Tenders

At some point during their stay in the city, the party will run into one of the Tenders speaking to a crowd in the canopy market.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A frail young huden gallus stands on a crate in the market square, trying to catch the attention of the passing crowd. "The fires are spreading more and more by the day. We need help to quell the blaze! Please, join with the Tenders and help us heal our Wood!" As he speaks, a shy looking sable luma stands awkwardly to the side of him. No one seems to be taking much interest in the gallus' speech, and some are openly derisive.
^0b0

The gallus is named [Havel of the Autumn Moon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/havel-of-the-autumn-moon-hwcs.md) and the luma is [Tevor of the Spring Path](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tevor-of-the-spring-path-hwcs.md). They both wear the robes of Tenders, though Havel seems to have more authority than Tevor. Havel will recognize the party as the Defenders of Alderheart, and inform them that he had a friend in the caravan attack last month who survived thanks to their efforts. He has heard of the party's deeds since they arrived in Alderheart, and will admit to a bit of jealousy. He wishes he were able to go out and help survivors of the fires across the Wood, but he is frail and lacks the fortitude to work in such conditions.

Tevor seems incredibly nervous, and informs Havel that he wouldn't be so quick to say things like that if he'd ever been to the Scorched Grove. Tevor has been helping heal the Grove, and will relate that lately things have been very difficult for the Tenders there, with many being injured or worse due to monster activity.

Tevor was summoned to Alderheart by the Council just like the party, but he isn't sure why. It's clear from the pained expression on Havel's face that there's more to the story. A DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check will reveal Tevor is lying. Tevor won't answer anymore questions about his summons, and he will leave if pressed for information. So long as Tevor isn't around, Havel can be made to divulge what he knows with a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check: Tevor only barely escaped an encounter with an unknown monster that has been hunting Tenders in the Scorched Grove. Tevor doesn't talk about it, but Havel heard that Tevor's instructor died.

Havel will share that he'll likely see the party again soon, since he and Tevor are both due to attend the Council chambers tomorrow.

## An Emergency Session

When the characters enter the Council chambers they are met with an unusual sight: it is filled with people! Birdfolk, humblefolk, Tenders, and even a few people from beyond the Wood have assembled here:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> All those assembled clamor over each other, their pleas desperate. Some are urging for an immediate removal of all Tenders from the Grove before more lives are lost. Some are calling for a mobilization of the Perch Guard to meet the monsters head on. It seems everyone has an opinion and is fighting to be heard. Tevor and Havel are here as well, standing patiently off to the side of the rabble.
^0b2

Shortly after the party enters, the familiar bright gallus seated in the middle of a long table at the front of the hall raises her feathered hand. This is [Bita, the Council Speaker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/bita-the-council-speaker-hwcs.md). She waits patiently as many of the gathered birdfolk notice her gesture and fall silent. The silence in the hall is almost overwhelming in its contrast to the noise that filled it moments before.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> When Bita speaks it is not with a booming voice or harsh language. The sound of command and respect permeate her every word. She addresses you and your companions simply. "Thank you all for heeding our summons so quickly. The Wood is in great need, and many of our Tenders have already paid the dearest price to protect it. We hope you will hear our pleas and offer us your aid in this most dire of circumstances."
^0b3

Speaker Bita continues by describing clouds of emberbats, in larger numbers than have ever been seen. She speaks of strange fire creatures sighted in the Wood, and how they have injured many travelers. She then talks about the missing Tenders and the reports of a huge, unknown creature stalking the ash plains of the Grove. Something must be done, which is why the Council has called upon the help of the Defenders of Alderheart. Bita offers whatever information she can, but this creature is a new discovery and the Council has little to go on.

Tevor is called up before the head table. He was the most recent Tender to encounter the massive beast in the Grove. He recalls seeing the ash of the plains seize up, as if some-thing were burrowing through. The creature never broke the surface, so he was unable to get a good look at it. It must have grabbed his instructor, though, as Tevor saw him get sucked under the ash. Tevor ran, until he was safe on the edge of the Scorched Grove.

Tevor is obviously shaken after the account, but Havel places a hand on his shoulder, which seems to comfort him.

Tevor points out on a map where this most recent sighting took place. Bita will mention that the Grove is a dangerous place, and ask Havel to look for someone to guide the party. At first, Tevor simply raises his hand to speak. It's clear that he is conflicted and his fear is getting the better of him. Despite this, he'll firmly state that he will guide the party to where he last saw the creature. He will admit his fear, but every second they waste is a chance for it to strike again.

## The Scorched Grove

The great ashen plain that stretches across the northwest forest has come to be called the Scorched Grove. The Grove is the result of a massive forest fire known as the Great Calamity, which raged centuries ago. It left the area altered, and strongly connected to the magic of elemental fire. This barren place has remained in such a state for as long as anyone in the Wood can remember.

> [!note] A Tender's Telling
> 
> The story of the Calamity that has been passed down through the Tenders goes like this:
> 
> "Long ago, birdfolk thought they could stop forest fires from devastating the Wood by using powerful otherworldly magics. But the plan backfired. Their magics only fueled the flames, and the Grove was consumed. By the grace of the Amaranthine, the birdfolk were able to lull the blaze into a quiet slumber. Though the flames were contained, the act unbalanced the elemental forces of the Wood for generations. This is why only gentle magics are used to help the earth heal. With nature, the slow way is the right way."
^a-tenders-telling

## Approaching the Grove

To get to the Scorched Grove by road the party will need to head back toward Winnowing Reach, then continue west until the road nears the southern edge of the Grove. While this is the easiest path, it will take four days to arrive at the location where Tevor last saw the beast. If the party takes the long road, they are not at risk of an encounter.

Alternatively, the party can take a more direct approach through the forest to the northeastern edge of the Grove, very near where the beast was last spotted.

If the party takes the direct approach, they will reach their destination in two days, but they'll likely run into some trouble. After one of the following encounters (either **A Cloud of Emberbats** or **The Flaming Specter**), the party will make good time to the location described by Tevor. Choose one of the encounters below.

### A Cloud of Emberbats

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> While nearing the Scorched Grove, you begin to hear a faint sound far off in the distance. The sound quickly grows louder, and a cacophony of screeches reaches your ears before you see the source: a great cloud of emberbats is consuming the sparse forest to the north. They are still a distance away, but you can feel the combined heat of their bodies even from here. A bright and mysterious orange light can occasionally be seen shining in between them. 
^0b8

Tevor will try to sound calm as he advises against rushing in blindly, but it's clear that he's frightened of this swarming mass of emberbats. He'll support the party however he can while maintaining a safe distance.

The emberbat cloud takes up the space of a Huge creature, and it has 103 hit points and resistance to slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage. It also has the following properties:

- It can fly at a speed of 30 feet per round and it begins 60 feet away from the party.  
- The heat generated by the emberbats is so intense that any creature within 30 feet must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw when they enter this area, or start their turn inside of it, taking 4 (`1d8`) points of fire damage on a failure.  
- The emberbats' space can be entered and moved through freely, but the heat inside is so intense that creatures inside this area take 7 (`2d8`) points of fire damage if they end their turn inside it.  

Any creature that enters the emberbats' space will see that they are swarming around a glowing ball of molten orange energy. This orb is only a foot across and shines like a miniature sun, making it difficult to target.

The orb can be attacked, and has the following properties:

- AC 18  
- 30 hit points  
- Immunity to fire damage  
- Vulnerability to cold damage  
- Resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage dealt by non-magical weapons  
- It is magic, and registers as conjuration magic if examined with [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) or a similar effect  

Once this orb is destroyed, the cloud of emberbats will gradually disperse, taking 4 rounds to disappear completely. If the bats are killed, but the orb remains, the orb will fly off in a random direction at a speed of 60 feet per round, streaking through the forest, eventually slowing down as it attracts a new cloud of emberbats.

Whatever type of energy the orb was, it seemed to be exciting the emberbats, driving them to cloud in large numbers. A difficult DC 17 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check will be enough for a character to ascertain similarities between this phenomena and similar instances mentioned in conjuration textbooks: when high-level conjuration circles deteriorate, such energy nodes have been observed being intermittently released.

### The Flaming Specter

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> While making your way through the tranquil forest, you see what looks to be a blazing fire off in the distance. As you look at the fire, you notice the flames have taken on a birdfolk-like form, resembling a weeping corvum. It's far enough away that you could make it past without being noticed, but branches of the trees around its body are already beginning to smolder.
^0ba

This creature is a fire specter, a memory of a former inhabitant of the Scorched Grove animated by the flames that took its life. Tevor will be able to identify the creature immediately. He'll also add that such entities are only found in the deepest parts of the Grove, and it's unheard of to see one so far from the Grove itself. The Tenders are taught to leave them be, as they will dissipate once they have fulfilled their purpose, which usually consists of re-enacting a memory from the life of the victim. Tevor will warn the party that disturbing the specter risks invoking its wrath.

If characters interact with the specter peacefully, read this:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you approach, the creature appears unaware of your presence. It is on its knees, and continues to fruitlessly grasp at something in the underbrush, only to burn any plant life it touches. With each failed attempt the creature places its head in its talons and shudders in a way that suggests weeping.
^0bb

The memory this creature is enacting is one of picking flowers to place at a nearby gravesite. Players must figure this out on their own. If a character examines the area, with a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check they will be able to locate an overgrown wooden grave marker covered by reeds. The singed, desiccated bush the specter keeps reaching for matches bushes on either side of it, around which small patches of bluebells grow. Simply gathering any number of these flowers and placing them upon the grave will be enough to cause the specter to dissipate harmlessly.

Remind the players that their time is limited, as the mere presence of the specter is causing trees and shrubs around it to smoke. Characters can attempt to quench the flames before they become true blazes, but unless they have a way to do this at range, they'll need to get within 5 feet of the fire specter. Any character that lingers too long near the specter takes 5 (`1d10`) fire damage from its heat. Have characters continue to take fire damage the longer they stay in close proximity to the fire specter.

If a player disturbs the creature in any way or attempts to harm it, it will turn and attack. The fire specter uses the stat block for a [fire elemental](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental.md), but it is Medium and has only 51 hit points. The creature can be lured into a nearby clearing to prevent more fires. It will attack ferociously until it has been slain, at which point it will dissolve into smoke and ash.

## Reaching the Grove

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The forest gives way to expansive plains of ash, dotted with the charred husks of petrified trees. The wind here has a heat to it, and it constantly disturbs the ashen soil. As it blows, small embers can be seen forming in the disturbed ash, glowing briefly before being swept up and fading on the wind. This place is clearly unnatural.
^0bd

Regardless of the route party took, once they arrive at the location described by Tevor they will need to locate the creature that has been preying on the Tenders. A DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check or other tracking skill is needed to follow its trail. On a failure, it takes another day of searching to catch sight of the creature. Optionally, roll on the [Scorched Grove Encounters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/appendix-e-random-encounters-scorched-grove-encounters-level-3-hwcs.md) table if the party fails to find the [ashsnake](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/ashsnake-hwcs.md).

> [!note] Paying the Price
> 
> To add some urgency or consequences to the player's decisions, or to complicate matters, announce that by the time they locate the ashsnake it has already found another Tender and is attacking them! Not only must the party fight the beast, they must do so while attempting to save the Tender from meeting a deadly fate.
> 
> Have combat start with the party being surprised by the ashsnake ambushing the fleeing Tender. The ashnake will burst from the ground next to the Tender as they try to escape.
> 
> The Tender has 30 hit points and can cast the [druidcraft](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/druidcraft.md) and [spare the dying](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/spare-the-dying.md) cantrips. They have no combat ability, but they make any rolls to escape being grappled at a +2 bonus. In combat, they act directly after the ashsnake.
^paying-the-price

## Ashsnake Attack

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Suddenly, you see what looks to be a disturbance in the ashen plains. Something is moving underneath the thick coating of cinders at frightening speeds, churning up burning embers on either side as it goes, before vanishing. Something is here, and it has noticed you.
^0c0

The [ashsnake](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/ashsnake-hwcs.md) starts hidden in the ash. The first time it attacks, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A creature resembling a huge molten snake breaks the ashen surface with incredible force! Its scales are like charcoal, and between the scales a sinister orange glow issues from its molten core. This same glow can be seen coming from two points on the creature's head, resembling eyes, though whether or not it uses these to see is unclear. 
^0c1

The ashsnake can feel vibrations within 60 feet of itself, and will attack if it senses movement within range of its bite or constrict attacks. If it senses the party grouping up, it will unleash its breath attack on them. If attacked from outside the range of its [tremorsense](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#tremorsense), the ashnake takes an action to determine the direction from which the attack originated.

During the fight, the ashsnake will try to stay under the ash to protect itself, but it will come up to attack when it senses an opening. Have it burrow or surface to make the fight interesting.

Here are a few points to remember:

- The ashsnake will generally surface near characters to try and knock them over with its eruption ability. If anyone falls [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone), they can expect to have a grab attack launched against them, or a bite attack if the creature is already grappling a character.  
- The ashsnake can be attacked while under the ash, although it has a bonus to its armor class (as noted in the monster's description).  
- The ashnake can also hide under the ash, but to do this it needs to spend an action making a Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check opposed by each character's passive perception score. While hidden in this way the ashsnake is functionally [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible), although characters can make a Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check against its initial roll once on their turn (this doesn't cost an action), determining its location on a success. Anytime the ashsnake emerges it is no longer hidden.  
- The ashsnake can grab characters before burrowing, and can move freely underground with a grappled character in tow. Each time a character starts their turn under the ash they need to hold their breath (which they can do for 1+ their Constitution modifier's worth of minutes before they start to suffocate). This resets every time the creature surfaces, giving the character a chance to gasp for air. If a character cannot hold their breath, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking one level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) on a failure.  
- The ashsnake isn't very intelligent, but it understands how to hunt prey. It is drawn to loud noises and heavy movements. A party member could attempt to distract it in this way.  
- The ashsnake will always try to have one creature grappled while it bites, and will use its ash breath as often as it can, provided there are enough targets close together for it to hit.  

## Outrunning the Fire

As soon as the ashsnake is slain, the following will happen in the Grove:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The earth shakes, nearly knocking you and your companions from your feet. All around you ashsnakes erupt through massive mounds of ash. They rear up, emitting a terrifying hiss, a sound so shrill it's as though the air were being rent. As the ashsnakes encircle you, there is a deeper rumble, less violent but full of power. The creatures hesitate for a moment, until another more powerful tremor shakes even their massive bodies. The ashsnakes flee, heading south and burrowing into the ash. The tremors continue to gain in momentum and intensity. To the north, miles away, something gigantic rises from a bed of cinders. First a hill, then a small mountain, releasing a plume of ash that blocks the sun. As the dust clouds settle, you see a huge creature made of craggy black rock and pulsing orange magma. It bellows a guttural sound unlike anything you've ever heard and begins to march toward your position.
^0c3

The [aspect of fire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/aspect-of-fire-hwcs.md) is a primeval elemental whose very being thrums with rage. Try to avoid calling it the "aspect of fire" in front of your players, as this creature is currently unknown to them. If a character wants to make an Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check to see if they know of it, a roll of 16 or higher would be enough for them to have heard of the aspect of fire through scant tales and myths. The stories say that this creature's sole desire is to consume, heedless of the destruction it leaves in its wake. Characters would not know anything more than this.

The aspect will immediately sense the party of intruders in its Grove, and make for them at full speed. It's obvious from the size and power of this creature that taking it on would be folly. Be sure to communicate this to the players. However, any party member who stays to make a noble sacrifice will surely buy time for their companions to escape.

The party can make whatever plans they want, but the shortest distance out of the aspect's path is back into the forest toward Alderheart. Any other path out of the Grove would leave them exposed to the aspect's march or ashsnakes that could be following. The forest canopy should also provide some cover from the creature, making the party difficult to target.

Tevor will flee immediately into the forest, making his escape before the party can react. This is the simplest way to resolve the matter, but if it makes sense within the story, you can have Tevor sacrifice himself to buy the party time to escape, or to save a party member in the following chase sequence.

Have the players describe how they would make their way to safety. The easiest way to resolve this would be to have each character make a DC 14 Strength or Dexterity ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to attempt to outrun the aspect. Allow players to make different ability checks if they can come up with a unique way for their characters to escape the threat. For example, distracting the creature might be somewhat of a challenge, requiring a DC 14 Charisma or Intelligence ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check, but attempting to restrain it would be more difficult.

Once they have succeeded on the first skill check, have each player make another skill check to determine how successful they are at fleeing as the creature continues to move toward them. Make this check easier or harder depending on how well players did on the first check. If players succeed at this check, their character flees at a sufficiently quick pace to avoid being in range of the creature's attacks. Particularly dire failures on this check could result in characters falling [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).

As the aspect marches, it indiscriminately hurls massive boulders of magma and rock into the forest. Characters who failed the second skill check have fallen behind and are in range of these attacks. They must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw at the start of each round. On a failure, they take 16 (`3d10`) fire damage. On a success, they take half that damage. They may then attempt another skill or ability check to flee out of the creature's range. As above, be flexible here, and try to reward players for creativity while keeping the threat to their characters believable.

After about two rounds of pursuit, the characters should notice that the aspect isn't gaining as quickly, and after another round the characters will all have made it out of the creature's range regardless. If any look back, all they will see is an ominous red glow through the trees, and a plume of thick smoke rising up over the horizon. From here the characters are free to make their way safely into the forest and back to Alderheart.

## Flee to Alderheart

A large part of the forest has been burned away in the wake of the [aspect of fire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/aspect-of-fire-hwcs.md), but it seems to have mysteriously given up chase. The party has made it back to the city safely. Having heard and felt the massive aspect's movement, the Council is eager to hear a firsthand account of what happened in the Grove.

The Council members accept the news with sadness, anger, concern, and confusion. Whatever this creature is, it represents a threat to all life in the Wood. Many elementals have resided in and around the forest for centuries, but this one harbors a rage that the Council doesn't understand.

A sage looking Council member will mention that she once heard tales of an elemental creature of great size and power called an aspect of fire, but that she hopes this is not the monster they face. Another Council member will mention that the first rule of battle is "know thine enemy," and add that the Dean of the Avium, a sable luma named [Gabe Windsworth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gabe-windsworth-hwcs.md), is incredibly knowledgeable. He may be able to offer some insight on the situation. Council Speaker Bita will agree, and state that should the Dean be unable to assist the party, the Avium is still home to the largest library in the Wood and its tomes may be the party's best chance at finding answers.

The Council is interested in any information that can be found regarding this creature. More than that, they would welcome a means of defeating it. In the meantime, they will begin to rally the Perch Guard in case Alderheart should come under threat. The party must now embark on a quest to stop this monster, before it consumes the land.

Thick plumes of smoke from the massive blaze the party outran can be seen from Alderheart's canopy, and news of both the awoken creature and the destruction it has wrought spreads through the whole city quickly.

If Tevor led the party, and returned with them, he will be granted the rank of Summerblossom for his valor. He will head up the effort to quell the forest fires the aspect has started. If he did not return, Havel will lead the relief effort, drawing on the memory of his friend to inspire the crowd, and Tevor will be given a solemn funeral. Either way, many volunteers, both humblefolk and birdfolk, will sign up to help quell the still-raging flames and assist those injured in the blaze. The party can choose whether or not they wish to aid in this effort, but nobody will begrudge them if they need to rest after their ordeal.

> [!note] Treasure
> 
> The party will be given a special requisition from the Council to aid in fulfilling their mission to stop the creature. Characters will be able to use this unassuming piece of parchment, stamped with the seal of Alderheart, to requisition up to 500 gp worth of equipment from any shop in the city. This can be used in separate stores, or all at the same place. Likewise, it can be used to pay for a portion of an item, such as a weapon or piece of armor, with the rest needing to be paid in coin.
> 
> In order to obtain this discount players must explain how the requisitioned goods will aid them in their mission. Some shopkeepers may require more convincing than others.
> 
> The requisition is stamped on the back by a merchant each time it is redeemed, and notarized with the amount it was used for. This can be altered with a difficult skill check using a [forgery kit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/forgery-kit.md). However, modifying the document constitutes thievery, and any character caught doing this will be arrested and brought before the Council to face punishment.
> 
> Characters will also be rewarded with a [feathered helm](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/feathered-helm-hwcs.md) from the Tenders for their good work. If Tevor awards characters this item, it will come with a gallus feather, given by Havel, to thank the party for helping Tevor return safely.
> 
> If Tevor died, have Havel gift them the helm instead. It will contain a luma feather in memory of his lost friend. If the optional variant **Paying the Price|HWCS|3|Reaching the Grove** was used for the ashsnake encounter, the Tender the party saved may award them the helm, fitted with an appropriate feather.
