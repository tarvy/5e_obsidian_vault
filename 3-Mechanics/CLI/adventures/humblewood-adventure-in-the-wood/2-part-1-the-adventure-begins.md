Part 1 of the adventure is designed to start a party of 1st level characters off on their journey in the world of Humblewood. The kinds of characters players create will influence how the campaign begins.

If characters are not playing races described in this book, perhaps they have heard legends of Humblewood, and have traveled or were brought here to explore the wonders of the forest. Maybe the newcomers have come to see the magnificent city of Alderheart, or to seek an audience with the Birdfolk Council. Any number of stories can be crafted about why standard 5th Edition races have ended up in the Wood, but keep in mind that they might be viewed as curiosities as they travel the land. Most folk in Humblewood haven't seen outsiders like them before.

If characters are birdfolk or humblefolk, have them start their adventure as residents of Meadowfen, a small village south of the Scorched Grove, near the main road.

## Sleepy Meadowfen

Meadowfen has been quiet for as long as anyone can remember, and life there goes by slowly. Recently, Meadowfen has fallen on hard times. Seasonal rainfalls haven't arrived, leaving the fields barren. To make matters worse, trade wagons sent to provide relief have gone missing, fueling rumors of bandits prowling the roadways. Fire-based creatures are venturing closer to the village than ever before. A week ago, an ominous plume of black smoke to the north blocked the sun. A few brave villagers ventured out to investigate, but they haven't returned. The source of the smoke remains unknown.

The sleepy village of Meadowfen is the perfect home for aspiring adventurers who dream of fantastical quests across Humblewood. The recent chaos surrounding the settlement presents ample opportunity for a group of heroes to get their feet wet. Meadowfen also works well as a staging ground for new arrivals to the Wood, as there are few here who the village Elder can turn to for help in these times. It would be fortuitous if a group of travelling adventurers were to show up.

Wherever the journey begins, one of the locals who went to investigate the black smoke in the north will return, badly wounded and in need of aid.

### The Great Blaze

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> There is a commotion in the village square. A wounded strig woman limps towards the Meadowfen Elder's home, staggering and catching herself on the side of a well. She is bloodied, and her tawny feathers are singed and flecked with ash and soot.
^00a

The birdfolk, [Cara Stormsinger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/cara-stormsinger-hwcs.md), is one of the villagers who left a week ago to investigate the smoke to the north.

Cara will take water if it is offered, but will refuse other aid as she is adamant about getting to the village Elder.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I must speak to the Elder, we are all in grave danger. The Grove has taken an entire town." At this moment, a wizened gallus, who was sitting on her front porch, rises and pulls open her door, waving for Cara to come. Cara cannot carry herself anymore.
^00b

If a party member does not assist her, a villager helps Cara into the Elder's house. The gallus, [Ardwyn, Elder of Meadowfen](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ardwyn-elder-of-meadowfen-hwcs.md) grants entrance to Cara and the party. Many villagers will try to follow Cara, but Ardwyn will turn them away. It is clear the party was only allowed into Ardwyn's home because she wants to speak with them.

If any party member has proficiency in the [Medicine](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Medicine) skill, they will be given time to tend to Cara's wounds.

Impatiently, Ardwyn approaches Cara.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "It's clear you have endured much, my child," the respected gallus says, motioning to the party to gather around. "But we must know what happened out there."
^00c

Cara explains that the fires from the Scorched Grove have spread to the hillside town of Ashbarrow and razed it to the ground. Cara warns that the roads are full of bandits. Luckily, she escaped with her life. Others, Ashbarrow citizens fleeing their burning homes, were not so lucky. Cara doesn't know where those captured by the bandits were taken.

The Elder, understanding how serious this is, asks the party to travel to Alderheart, to speak to the Birdfolk Council and inform them of Ashbarrow's destruction and of the bandit activity on the roads near Meadowfen. The party may be the only ones who can make the dangerous journey.

### Five Finger Discount

As the party sets out from Meadowfen, four hooded figures will come into view on the road ahead.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Three hooded figures are gesturing violently at a crumpled body on the ground, while a fourth is leaning against a nearby tree. A small hand-cart stacked high with bags and boxes of various sizes stands nearby. One of the hooded figures goes to the cart and unceremoniously sifts through the packages, leaving fallen bundles strewn on the road.
> 
> As you approach the three strangers who were gesturing at the body, you can see the pointed faces of mapach under the hoods. Two male and one female mapach, each wearing worn leather armor and a short sword on their belt. The fourth, an intimidating vulpin female, is lightly armored and wears an ornate sword on her hip. She seems to be hanging back, letting her subordinates do all the work.
> 
> You hear a whimpered "Help me" from the creature laying on the road, but you can't make out their features. The mapach female, still standing near the fallen body, puts her hands on her hips and says to the party, "All right folks, nothing to see. Move along if you know what's good for ya."
^00e

The vulpin leading these three [mapach bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md) is a powerful foe named [Fray Merridan](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/fray-merridan-hwcs.md). She represents a serious threat to the party, but won't take interest in them unless she has a reason to believe the characters are a worthy challenge.

Assuming the party doesn't want to fight, the bandits will leave if bribed. They are reasonable robbers, and will gladly relinquish the cart if the party can offer a worthy sum. Negotiations start with Fray evaluating the cart's contents. She and her crew will simply walk away for 10 gp each. Players can roll opposed Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) or ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks against a Wisdom check made by Fray to negotiate for a lower price, but the bandits won't leave for anything less than 5 gp each.

Believing they have the upper hand, the bandits won't hesitate to attack if they sense trepidation or suspect that the party might be up to something. Any threats or posturing from the characters will be met with an attack from the three mapach bandits. This fight shouldn't be too difficult, as the party likely outnumbers the bandits and are probably better equipped.

Fray will stay back and let the party fight the bandits for a round or two. She will intervene after two rounds or when a bandit is brought down. Fray will target the character who looks to be the most capable in single combat. If the party is larger than four players, she will engage in combat from the start, ordering her underlings to deal with the others.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Joining the fight, the bandit captain says, "Intriguing. You look like you might actually give me a proper fight!" The vulpin smirks and draws her blade, tracing intricate patterns in the air as she rushes into battle.
^00f

Fray is a deadly foe, but she wasn't prepared to have her heist interrupted. She won't risk her life needlessly if the odds turn against her. If at least two of the mapach bandits go down, she will make a tactical retreat into the dense forest, where she can easily disappear in the foliage. While escaping, she will swear revenge and leave any unfortunate underlings to the party's mercy.

The terrain is difficult for the party, but not for Fray, who is familiar with the area. Any character trying to pursue Fray on foot will quickly lose her in the forest unless they can make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check each round. The dense forest also makes gliding difficult. Most birdfolk can't glide through the trees, but Small birdfolk characters can attempt to glide after Fray, avoiding trunks and branches with a DC 15 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check.

Failure on either the Wisdom or Dexterity check means the character has lost sight of Fray and ends the chase for that character. A character successfully chasing Fray through the woods means the party catches up with her, at which point she will surrender. If four rounds have passed since her retreat, the party has lost Fray.

Should the party choose to try and locate Fray by continuing down the road, they will arrive at a clearing where a river separates them from a dense forest on the other side. A heavy log sits with one end on riverbank and the other end in the water, preventing the party from crossing the river and chasing Fray.

If the party continues through any forest terrain, they will need to make regular [Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival) checks to avoid becoming lost in the trees. Use the [Forest Encounters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/appendix-e-random-encounters-forest-encounters-level-1-2-hwcs.md) table for an especially persistent group. Make it clear that the vulpin has made her getaway, covering her tracks well enough that following her is fruitless.

If the encounter should go horribly awry, the bandits won't bother capturing the party or finishing them off. Rather, they will retreat, stealing as much from the hand-cart as they can carry. After all, the bandits aren't sure there won't be reinforcements coming to the rescue. If a player consents, their character can earn a scar from their battle with Fray in order to heighten anticipation for the rematch later.

> [!note] Treasure
> 
> The mapach bandits are wearing worn leather armor and each one carries a poorly-kept [short sword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shortsword.md). If they are defeated and searched, the party also finds a small coin purse with 5 gp inside it.
> 
> ***If Fray is defeated.*** She is wearing a suit of [studded leather armor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/studded-leather-armor.md) (obviously pilfered), and a finely crafted [shortsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shortsword.md) with a rose insignia on the pommel. The sword is not magical, but it will sell for double the normal going rate of a shortsword. Any lower level bandit who sees a character wearing the sword will immediately recognize it as a captain's sword. So long as the sword is visible, all bandits of a rank lower than captain will have disadvantage on any rolls made to oppose Charisma ([Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) ability checks made by that character. The party will also find among Fray's possessions 10 gp, and a map which has the location of a bandit camp marked (see Bandit Camp).

### Escorting Eliza

After defeating or bribing the bandits, the characters can help the beaten figure lying in the road to her feet. If they don't engage with her immediately, have her grunt or whine to attract attention. If they still don't assist, the merchant eventually sits up on her own. She is [Eliza Pennygleam](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/eliza-pennygleam-hwcs.md), an eluran who hails from lands beyond Humblewood. It's fairly common to see eluran traders in these parts, and the merchant is happy to explain that she has traveled here to set up shop.

If the characters were defeated by the bandits, Eliza will be the one who revives them, healing each character for `2d4+2` hit points using the last of a supply of poultices from her small hand-cart. She will curse the bandits who stole from her, but will still be grateful to the party for their valiant efforts.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "My whiskers, that was close! Thank you all for protecting me and my cart. My name is Eliza. I'm on my way to Alderheart by way of Winnowing Reach. Would you be kind enough to help me the rest of the way?"
^012

In case the characters are unfamiliar with the Wood, Eliza describes the road ahead. She explains that it works its way along the edge of Mokk Fields, a large swampland, before reaching Winnowing Reach, a small research outpost whose inhabitants study the slimes that live in the nearby caverns.

Eliza's plan was to stop briefly in Winnowing Reach, to sell her wares and acquire new stock, before eventually making her way to Alderheart.

If the characters seem reluctant to aid her, she will entice them by offering each character a single item from her cart in exchange for their protection and company on the road—to be awarded upon arrival.

If the party decides to walk with Eliza, their movement speed is reduced considerably as she pulls her cart behind her. A strong character can offer to pull the heavy-laden hand-cart instead. Succeeding a DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check keeps everyone moving at regular traveling speed, while failure means the party continues slowly.

### B-b-b-bats!

The road to Winnowing Reach keeps the party just out of reach of the swamplands on the right.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you make your way down the road, terrain on the left side changes considerably. Beyond the lush green trees lining the road, glimpses of burned stumps and ash-covered fields can be seen. It looks as if a massive fire recently ravaged this place.
^014

This bleak landscape seems to stretch for miles. While looking out over this gray scene, the characters may notice a cloud of creatures flying above the ash. Those who keep an eye on the creatures, or characters with a passive perception score of 15 or higher, notice the cloud change course and begin flying toward the party.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A swarm draws near. You can see it is composed of hundreds of tiny flying creatures, each one resembling a bat with a candle-sized flame sprouting from above its upturned nostrils. The combined heat of their bodies can be felt on the wind.
^015

If the cloud's course change was noticed, the characters have about 10 seconds before the bats descend on them. If the bats flew unnoticed until this point, they arrive so swiftly that the characters do not have time to prepare for the attack.

The characters are beset by two [swarms of emberbats](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-emberbats-hwcs.md). The bats dive and harass their targets relentlessly until the bats are slain or the party is defeated. The swarm won't give chase for long, and can be escaped if the party is able to put considerable distance between themselves and the ashy plain.

## Winnowing Reach

With the flaming bats behind the party, the rest of the trip is uneventful. After a couple hours on the road, the village of Winnowing Reach comes into view.

Entering the Reach, Eliza thanks the party and tells them that she will set up in the center of town to see what she can sell or trade.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Have a rest," Eliza says. "You are going to need it for when you escort me to Alderheart." She winks.
^017

If Eliza promised the characters an item for accompanying her to Winnowing Reach, they can claim that now. Each player can choose a piece of adventuring gear worth 50 gp or fewer as a reward.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Come find me when you are ready to head north," she calls out as she walks away.
^018

Characters are free to explore Winnowing Reach, though they will find the amenities of this research station to be lacking compared to other settlements of its size. There is a general store and a small inn with a tavern, but instead of staples like a weapon or armorsmith, the town has an apothecary and a bookbinder. The following numbered locations refer to Fig.1.1: the map of Winnowing Reach.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/adventure/HWAitW/Winnowing-Reach.webp#center)

### 1. Storage and Granary

This large building houses slime residue, which will eventually be exported across the Wood, as well as collected foodstuffs from nearby farms. It is a hub of activity, with laborers moving about constantly under the watchful eye of Winnowing Reach's town militia.

### 2. Town Gaol

As it is not a large settlement, Winnowing Reach has only a small gaol. Looked after by a [birdfolk guard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-guard-hwcs.md) who commands the small local militia, it's usually empty. If the party has any captive bandits in tow, this gaol should hold them until a wagon from Alderheart arrives to bring outlaws to the capital for sentencing.

### 3. Magistrate's Office

A stately building in the center of town serves as the official chambers for the local magistrate. Two [birdfolk militia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-militia-hwcs.md) guard the stairway that leads up to the platform upon which the building rests. Entry to this building is generally denied unless it is for official business (in response to a summons by the magistrate, for example).

### 4. Eliza's Cart

Although she isn't particularly well-stocked at the moment, Eliza's cart contains a variety of wares available for barter or trade. Eliza has an odd assortment of equipment from the Weapons, Tools, Adventuring Gear, and Trade Goods sections of the Core Rules. Rather than determining what she has in her cart ahead of time, whenever a character wishes to purchase an item from her, roll a `d6`. If the result is an even number, she has such an item with her, while if the result is odd, she does not. Eliza is interested in expanding her wares, and will accept a trade for an item of greater value instead of payment in gold pieces.

### 5. Apothecary

The apothecary has [potions of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md), [healer's kits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/healers-kit.md), and [herbalism kits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/herbalism-kit.md) for sale. They also sell swamp herbs, philters, and other raw materials, which can be used to make potions of healing. It costs half the price of a completed potion to buy enough reagents to craft one. Any character proficient with an herbalism kit can craft a potion.

### 6. The Bookbindery

The bookbinder has a small library of assorted tomes to offer, and a few strange books may be found among the modest collection. Books can be purchased for 1 gp each. Some books may confer an advantage on the next Intelligence check made to see what a character knows about a creature, object, or location when read, depending on their subject matter.

### 7. The Wrangler's Rest

The local inn and tavern here in the Reach is a quiet place with quality rooms and decent food. The innkeep receives quite a few visitors from the Avium, along with the occasional adventurer looking to try their hand at slime wrangling. Treat the Wrangler's Rest as a Modest Inn.

### Reaching the Magistrate

At some point during the party's stay, word of the adventurers reaches the Magistrate, the ranking political figure in Winnowing Reach. He eventually tracks the party down and implores them to help find a missing researcher. He fears the lost researcher has entered the Mokkden Caverns to conduct hazardous research.

## The Missing Researcher

### She Slipped Away

A young corvum researcher looking to make a name for herself has recently gone missing. The Magistrate investigated her office, and learned she had been studying the nearby slimes in order to understand their physiology. Attempting to get live samples, she has ventured to the nearby caverns which are known to be infested with several species of slimes.

The town's magistrate, [Walden Krane, Magistrate of Winnowing Reach](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/walden-krane-magistrate-of-winnowing-reach-hwcs.md), petitions the characters to find the researcher, a young woman named [Kenna Brightspark](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kenna-brightspark-hwcs.md).

Once the party is properly rested, the Magistrate will approach them.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An agitated kindled corvum dressed in finery approaches you, his feathers ruffled with worry. "Adventurers? Thank Clhuran you happened here! Please, you must help me. Kenna, that foolish girl, has gotten in over her head! She ventured to the caverns looking for slimes, but hasn't returned for days! I can only hope she's still alive—you will help me, won't you?"
^023

If the party declines, the Magistrate can offer to use his position to get the party an audience with the Birdfolk Council in Alderheart. Certainly, they don't think the Council will just see just anyone, do they? Walden can write a letter of introduction to help the party get an audience, but he makes it clear he won't consider this until he is certain Kenna is safe. Should the party agree, Walden will express his gratitude, adding:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Oh, and if along your way, you just so happen to reduce the local slime population, the Reach would be grateful for your service..." Somewhat unconvincingly, Walden adds, "Of course, Kenna's safety comes first."
^024

For the service of killing a few slimes, the Magistrate also promises five gold pieces to each character.

If the party opts to find Kenna, the Magistrate will provide a rough map of Mokk Fields that has the entrances to the Mokkden Caverns marked.

## The Mokkden Caverns

The Mokkden Caverns are a network of caves and tunnels with several entrances dotting the Mokk Fields. The closest entrance to the Reach is located about half a day's hike south-west, in the middle of the swamp. Alternatively, there is a road that leads around the swamp to the south, arriving at another entrance at the very southwest edge of the swamp.

This is a longer route, most likely requiring a night of camping along the road, but it is safer than the swamp. The outside of the rocky caves are visible against the backdrop of the sunken Mokk Fields, though tall reeds and dead trees provide barriers to sight. The entrances can be spotted through the marsh from about 80 feet away.

> [!note] A Dangerous Swamp
> 
> Along the way, the party might run into bandits, or swamp creatures who want to make a meal of them. Decide what feels right for pacing and difficulty and add in an extra encounter here to ratchet up the action. Refer to the [Swamp Encounters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/appendix-e-random-encounters-swamp-encounters-level-1-hwcs.md) table for suggestions.
^a-dangerous-swamp

### General Features

> [!readaloud] A Dangerous Swamp
> 
> The inside of the caverns are dark, damp, and dank. It is evident that the murky waters of the surrounding swamp have inundated the system of tunnels beneath. Water drips from the glistening ceilings and gathers in pools throughout the caverns, filling the subterranean area with the harsh smell of rot. Tunnels descend gradually into the ground, curving gently back and forth as they go. The Mokkden Caverns are vast and largely uncharted.
^a-dangerous-swamp

The cave interior is dimly lit at best, with most of the natural light provided by glowing fungi that grows in the humid environment. Ceilings in the tunnels are about 10 feet high but can drop low enough in some places that Medium characters will need to hunch. Many of the open areas have ceilings that are 15 feet high unless otherwise specified.

The journey through the caverns can be made more difficult by incorporating difficult terrain. It can take the form of areas water-logged by the swamp seeping in or areas made slippery by dripping water and organic muck. While navigating slippery areas at more than half speed, a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw is required to avoid tripping and falling [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).

The slimes encountered within don't attack with reason or tactics. They lash out at the nearest target and attack until that target is subdued, even when assailed by multiple characters at the same time.

### Entrance

The closer entrance to the Mokkden Caverns juts out obviously from the surrounding mire. Be sure to roll on the [Swamp Encounters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/appendix-e-random-encounters-swamp-encounters-level-1-hwcs.md) table as the party approaches. They are taking a dangerous route through the swamp, and will likely run into trouble. When the party arrives, there are two [sticky slimes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/sticky-slime-hwcs.md) burbling about in front of this entrance.

The farther entrance can be spotted just as the forest gives way to marshlands. This cave opening has two [caustic slimes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/caustic-slime-hwcs.md) in front of it, wading through the fen looking for prey. This route will take the party longer to reach, but is safe enough that they shouldn't encounter anything else on the way.

The slimes are ostensibly combat encounters, but any character can make a DC 12 [Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception) check as they approach, easily spotting the slimes from 80 feet away on a success. On a failure the character does not notice the slimes until they are within 60 feet. If the party enters the range of the slime's [blindsight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#blindsight) (60 feet), the slime will attack. If the party can spot the slimes before then, they can attempt to pick the slimes off with ranged weapons and spells (treat the slimes as though they are [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded) if they are attacked beyond their [blindsight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#blindsight) radius).

Other methods, such as luring the slimes away with a distraction, or using stealth to slip by unnoticed, can also work. So long as the party didn't bumble into a slime's [blindsight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#blindsight) range, the party can avoid either encounter by succeeding on a DC 14 group Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check. If at least half of the party members succeed, they make it by quietly.

Despite being dangerous, the slimes are slow and easy to outrun, so be sure to let the party know that they can make a break for the entrance if they're spotted. The slimes will give up the chase a few rounds after the party moves outside of their [blindsight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#blindsight) range.

> [!note] Treasure
> 
> If the party defeats the slimes they will find 15 silver pieces undigested inside the creatures.
^treasure

### Collapsing Hazard

After about 30 minutes of walking in the caves, the party stumbles upon a 50-foot-long tunnel. It appears to be the only way forward, but seems dangerous to say the least.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You look down the tunnel in front of you. It is haphazardly propped up by makeshift frame made from wooden struts. The timeworn frame creaks audibly, and dust occasionally showers down from the ceiling into the tunnel. It looks like it could collapse at any moment.
^02c

The first researchers created supports to shore up hazardous rocks on the tunnel ceiling that threatened to collapse. In the years since, the struts have largely been ignored. The easiest way to circumvent the hazard is to collapse the struts on purpose, which can be accomplished in a few ways:

- ***Break the moisture rotted struts.*** This requires a successful DC 13 Strength check. Make sure to have players describe what methods they'll use for the Strength check and ensure that their choices won't leave them in the path of falling rocks (for example, using a 10-foot pole as a lever, or trying to throw a reasonably-sized object at the struts).  
- ***Determine weak spots in the structure.*** After a minute of observation, characters can determine weak spots in the structure. Striking these with a series of three hits against AC 10 with ranged weapons or spells will trigger the collapse.  
- ***Thunder damage.*** Any spell or ability that deals thunder damage can create enough of a shockwave to collapse the rocks.  
- ***A novel path forward.*** If the party is especially clever, create some ad hoc rules using the above as guidelines.  

Once the struts have collapsed, characters will need to navigate the debris-strewn ground (treat as difficult terrain) but will otherwise be fine.

Conversely, characters can attempt to go through the tunnel carefully. With a successful DC 14 group Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check, they can move through without disturbing the boulders. On a failure, their movement will trigger a small collapse. Characters must then make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 4 (`1d8`) points of bludgeoning damage from falling debris. Consider replacing the damage with a level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) if it deals too much damage to the party. Treat the collapsed tunnel as difficult terrain.

### Falling Slimes

After about 30 minutes of walking through the winding subterranean paths, the party arrives at a large cavern.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The tunnel opens up into a spacious cavern. Stalactites and stalagmites dot the floor and ceiling, the sound of dripping water can be heard slowly echoing in the distance.
^02e

The cavern is roughly 30 feet high and 60 feet across.

Two [sticky slimes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/sticky-slime-hwcs.md) and two [caustic slimes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/caustic-slime-hwcs.md) have heard the vibrations of possible prey passing through the adjoining tunnels, and are lying in wait upside-down on the ceiling. If players are being cautious and say they're keeping an eye out, a DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check is required to locate the motionless blobs against the dark ceiling.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Without warning, two sticky slimes and two caustic slimes drop down from above, surrounding you! Besides the entrance you just came through, you can make out three exits on the opposite side of this dark cavern.
^02f

The slimes land, encircling the group. Characters looking to flee can escape either through the three exits ahead or by backtracking through the tunnel they entered from. However, the ceiling in the entrance tunnel is 10 feet high, providing ample room for slimes to follow. There, any pursuing slimes are able to move upside down on the ceiling and attack from above. Fleeing through the three exits ahead is a simple matter—slimes don't move very quickly and the party should be able to lose them in a round or two.

There are three exits from the chamber:

- ***Exit 1***–a 15-foot-tall, 5-foot-wide exit that goes for 90 feet, and quickly narrows out to 10 feet in height before becoming a dead end.  
- ***Exit 2***–a 15-foot-tall, 10-foot-wide exit reinforced with rickety wooden beams to prevent cave-ins (like the one in the previous encounter). This exit must be navigated at half-speed in order to avoid triggering a collapse. Characters can intentionally cause a cave-in to drop rocks on any pursuing slimes. This leads to the next area.  
- ***Exit 3***–a smaller opening, about 4 feet tall and 4 feet wide. Medium or Larger creatures would need to squeeze through using half of their movement. The exit tunnel quickly widens to 15 feet in height, providing no imped-iment to movement beyond the entrance. After a minute, the tunnel curves to join up with Exit 2's tunnel (the one that leads to the next area).  

If the party successfully defeat the slimes, they will find that Exit 1 leads to a dead end that is safe, dry, and perfectly suited for a short rest.

### Slime Attack!

After another 30 minutes of walking through the caverns, the area will become dimly-lit (for the purpose of vision).

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Smears of luminescent residue line the walls of the tunnels. At first, the smears are sporadic, but soon there is enough faintly glowing goo to dimly light your surroundings.
> 
> Coming upon a space that seems to be the center of the cave, you see a young corvum standing next to a rock formation. Because of the sheen of slime covering the birdfolk, you are quickly able to deduce that she is in fact stuck to the rock! Her eyes go wide and suddenly focus on something above you. A giant slime drops down from the ceiling and attacks!
^032

The center of the cave is a 60-foot-wide clearing with tunnels branching off in different directions. Refer to Fig. 1.2 for a map of the Mokkden Caverns.

> This is a suggested setup for the battle with the Shifting Slime and the three Sticky Slimes. The party can find their way to the main chamber through any of the entrances marked with a white "X." Choose the entrance that makes the most sense based on the characters journey through the caverns so far. A suggested location for the trapped corvum researcher is provided, though she can be positioned anywhere up against the inner wall of the cavern. The hatched green lines represent the spaces that have been coated in sticky slime.
^using-the-mokkden-caverns-battlemap

The characters are beset by a [shifting slime](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/shifting-slime-hwcs.md) (the large slime), and three [sticky slimes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/sticky-slime-hwcs.md). The sticky slimes have left several residue trails between the characters and the chamber's entrance. Any character that steps into the trail becomes restrained unless they make a DC 10 Strength saving throw.

A character who hits a shifting slime with a damage dealing spell will notice the slime change color.

> [!note] Captured in Slime
> 
> If a character would die in combat, instead of dealing a killing blow, a sticky slime may instead try to encase the character in ooze, preserving them for later. A character reduced to 0 hit points in this way remains stable, but is rendered [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) and [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the ooze that encases them. The character will regain consciousness when they have at least 1 hit point, and can attempt to free themselves with a DC 12 Strength check, ending the restrained condition on a success. Other characters can attempt to free the restrained party member with a DC 12 Strength check.
^captured-in-slime

### Freeing the Researcher

To free Kenna from her slime prison, a character, using an action, needs to succeed on a DC 12 Strength check or use applicable spells. Once free, if the slimes are still a threat, Kenna will do her best to stay out of the way and follow orders that don't put her in danger. So long Kenna doesn't attack, the slimes will ignore her.

> [!note] Treasure
> 
> Inside the body of the shifting slime is a trinket that looks to be a small sphere, intricately woven from strands of gold and bronze. This is a [nest charm](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/nest-charm-hwcs.md). The charm's magical aura is faint from having been fed upon by the shifting slime, but it is very much intact.
^treasure

### Slime Sampling

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Kenna runs towards the adventurers. "Thank you for saving me, but, please, I need a sample!" the corvum says, her eyes filled with determination. She almost lost her life, but is now begging you to help her collect ooze samples from slimes. "I can give you something if you help me. Please, it's so important to my research. I can't go back to the Reach empty handed. I've come so far. I have risked so much. Please..." You can hear the desperation in her pleas.
^038

If characters refuse to help Kenna, a DC 10 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check is required to get her to come along.

If characters wish to assist the young researcher, Kenna has three vials she will pass out to anyone willing to help. One vial is sufficient for a sample.

The party must find a live slime from which to collect the sample. This can be accomplished by making a DC 12 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check.

The party can backtrack to find slimes they previously encountered in the caves, or the party can explore the Mokk Fields outside of the caverns for slimes. The [Swamp Encounters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/appendix-e-random-encounters-swamp-encounters-level-1-hwcs.md) table or the [Cave Encounters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/appendix-e-random-encounters-cave-encounters-level-1-hwcs.md) table can be used to decide what creatures lurk in the fields and caves.

## Returning to the Reach

The trip back to Winnowing Reach is uneventful, if a little slow, with the researcher tagging along. Magistrate Krane is relieved to see Kenna returned safely and is satisfied to hear there are fewer slimes in the Mokk Fields. For the service of killing a few slimes, the Magistrate awards 5 gp to each character.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Look!" Kenna says, holding up the vials of ooze up for the Magistrate to see. The Magistrate gives her a look of disapproval, which goes unnoticed. Nodding his head slightly to the travelers the Magistrate begrudgingly thanks the party. "It really wasn't necessary to go to all that trouble for a few samples...but thank you for your help."
^03a

Irrespective of if the Magistrate had promised a letter in exchange for the party's help, as thanks, Magistrate Krane promises he will write a letter to the Birdfolk Council on the party's behalf. However, before Krane can write the correspondence requesting that the Council grant an audience to the travelers, he must attend to an urgent problem in the Reach.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "If you are still around tomorrow, I will summon you to discuss this matter. I may need the help of adventurers and am willing to pay well for your assistance." And with that, the Magistrate leaves.
> 
> Kenna smiles at the group, "Alright, time to celebrate! How about some refreshments at the Wrangler's Rest? What do you say? First round is on me!"
^03b

Suggest spending the night in Winnowing Reach if it makes sense for the time of day, or if the characters need a rest. Add that in order to deliver Elder Ardwyn's message to the Birdfolk Council, a letter from the Magistrate would go a long way—it may be in the party's best interest to find out what he wants from the group.

## The Swamp Witch

### A Second Request

The next day, Magistrate Krane summons the party to his official chambers. The discussion requires some discretion and he doesn't want others overhearing.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Turning a few knobs and pushing a few levers, a clunk is heard, and the chamber door is bolted. Satisfied that you are alone, the Magistrate lets out a big sigh before turning around to face you. He looks concerned and tired. "The swamp," he begins hesitantly, "is home to a foul sorceress, a witch who dabbles in evil magics. I need you to discreetly take care of her. If it got out that I allowed this, I would be finished. Especially after what happened to Ashbarrow, everyone is scared. Think of the Wood. Do what is best for it. Do this one thing for me and I swear, I will write a letter to the Birdfolk Council."
^03e

At first the Magistrate appeals to the decency and goodness of the party, but if pressed, he will offer 5 gp per character to help deal with the witch. However, he'll also make it clear his coffers are running low. In order to prove they have dispatched the witch, Walden asks that the party obtain a distinctive amulet made from a small curled horn that she wears, after they've finished the job. It may be a demon's horn, the source of her evil powers, and he would see it destroyed with his own eyes.

### Traversing the Swamp

The Magistrate suspects the witch's lair can be found in the deepest, foulest stretches of the Mokk Fields.

To speed up travel, a character can make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to navigate the swamp and find signs of the witch.

Alternatively, a DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check could be used to determine the optimal location for magical activity within the swamp.

On a success, the party finds the witch after only a few hours of travel, leaving plenty of daylight. On a failure, it takes them longer to find the witch than anticipated, and the party arrives at dusk.

> [!note] Swamp Encounters
> 
> To add more action, consider rolling a `d20` for every hour of travel. On a roll of 5 or lower, roll again on the [Swamp Encounters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/appendix-e-random-encounters-swamp-encounters-level-1-hwcs.md) table to see what happens. The party can also stumble across an encounter from the table if they fail their check to navigate the swamp.
^swamp-encounters

### The Witch's Hut

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> At last you find yourselves at a small hut on a thin patch of dry land. There are a few gnarled trees, more moss than leaves, flanking the rustic hut. From the porch roof hangs dozens of bundles containing flowers, herbs, and some desiccated lizards.
> 
> Smoke gently rises from a cobblestone chimney, and a strange yet delicious smell fills the air. Through a window you can see a short, robed figure shuffling quickly about the kitchen, adding ingredients to a cauldron in the shape of a giant snail shell. There is also a rather large beetle skittering around, hopping at their master's heels. She leans over to pat the beetle affectionately, and it chitters in a way that is almost sweet.
^042

If the party opts to attack, [Susan of the Swamp](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/susan-of-the-swamp-hwcs.md) will defend herself. She will appeal to the party, explaining that she is not evil, merely misunderstood. During combat she will continue to try and explain that she means no harm, defending only with as much force as necessary to protect herself.

Should the party successfully kill the witch, they can easily retrieve the amulet from her body before heading back to inform the Magistrate of their success.

If the party approaches civilly, or Susan convinces them to stand down, they will learn that she is a friendly hedge witch who lives with her beetle familiar, Normal. Susan will explain that she relocated to the swamp in order to delve into secret and ancient magical lore on her own terms. In fact, when they walked in on her, she was in the middle of a ritual. It was her hope to summon an entity that she might question regarding a vision she had during a recent divination ritual.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I saw a great blaze consuming the Wood. Near the Scorched Grove, I think. There were figures, too. A large, lumbering, burning thing, and something else, shadowed and distant, watching from afar. Heh–that's lizard spleens for you. Their tea gives very cryptic visions. Shame I don't have any moonfish. You always get clear visions from moonfish... or was it starfish?"
^043

She asks if the party might help her gather the necessary ingredients to complete her ritual.

If asked about her amulet, she'll offer a throaty giggle and reply:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Oh, this old thing?" the hedge witch laughs, holding up the horn amulet. "This is just my old ocarina." She demonstrates by placing the horn to her lips and playing a few notes. "I used to study music at the College." She says with a wistful sigh, "Takes me back."
^044

The amulet has no special powers or worth, but it holds a great deal of personal significance to Susan. She won't assent to giving it up simply to appease the Magistrate, but she will consider giving it to the party if they agree to help her complete her ritual.

### Finding the Reagents

The characters are asked to gather some swamp herbs and capture a few plump green frogs, whose spleens are an essential component. Both can be found about an hour's walk north from the hut, near a large pond wreathed with dense reeds. The herbs are easy to locate with a successful DC 14 Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. On a failure, the characters do not find the herbs, but instead find one of the following items:

- a bull-rush root,  
- the shed tail of a swamp lizard,  
- a small scale, or  
- a feather, covered in muck.  

These items are magical reagents in their own right and can be turned in to Susan in exchange for potions. Players can roll as many [Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival) checks as they need to find the herbs.

The frogs are Tiny creatures with an armor class of 14, but they only have 1 hit point. The frogs will retreat into the pond's depths at the slightest hint of trouble, and characters require a DC 15 Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check to attack them.

There are enough frogs about that characters can find as many as they need. After three failed attempts to catch them, however, the players will trigger an event.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The ground around you begins to rumble, as a chorus of croaking rings in your ears. A gigantic frog bursts from the pond, fixing you and your companions with a hungry gaze!
^046

This frog resembles the smaller ones the party was trying to catch, but it is many times their size, and is looking to make a meal of the characters. Use the stats for a [giant toad](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-toad.md). Upon defeating the creature, a character can cut out its spleen easily, provided they don't mind getting covered in frog innards. The spleen is so large that Medium creatures must carry it with both hands, and Small creatures can barely carry it over their shoulder. The giant frog's spleen should provide ample material for the ritual.

After the party has gathered three frogs, or one spleen from the giant frog, they can return to the witch. If they returned with the giant frog's spleen, Susan will congratulate them and muse how lucky she is to have this for future experiments. She will save all that she doesn't use in stoppered glass jars.

### The last demon I summoned wouldn't stop talking...

Now that she has what she requires, Susan will start the ritual.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Susan draws the curtains on her windows. The only light source in the hut is the eerie green glow that emanates from the mixture bubbling in the large snail shell cauldron. Susan adds the final ingredients: first the herbs, which burn as they are incorporated into the mixture. This causes Susan to cackle with delight, while Normal clicks its mandibles cheerily. "O great spirit, heed my call!" Susan intones as she adds the frog spleens. "Rise and grant me the wisdom I seek!" The ritual ends with a flash, and a whoosh of air whips the curtains open.
^048

Refer to Fig. 1.3 for a map of Susan's Hut.

> Determine where the player characters are positioned when the fight breaks out. Suggested starting positions for the lesser demon and Susan are provided for ease of play. Should the fight spill outside, consider having the water areas of the map be difficult terrain.
^using-the-susans-hut-map

After a moment of trepidation, a [lesser demon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/lesser-demon-hwcs.md) climbs out of the cauldron, spilling the ritual mixture everywhere. Susan begins to ask the demon a flurry of questions. At first the demon seems uninterested, and is unresponsive to Susan's inquiries. Suddenly, it attacks the nearest person wildly, which may be Susan or a party member. It behaves confused and feral, remaining on the attack until defeated, at which point it crumbles into ash that floats away mysteriously.

## A Witch's Debt

Susan is grateful for your help in dispatching the demon. She admits she may have been a bit too ambitious with her summoning, and will adjust her future rituals accordingly. If the party asked her for her amulet (or if they ask her for it now), she'll part with it as thanks for stopping the demon before it could hurt anyone or destroy her home. Susan will also thank the party for warning her about the Magistrate, but assure them that she's accustomed to looking after herself.

If the party ever visits the Mokk Fields in the future, Susan promises her door will always be open. As the party walks away from the hut, it almost seems like Normal is waving goodbye.

The party may now call on Susan to make a variety of potions and brews in exchange for ingredients and a donation of 1 gp per potion. Refer to the table below for more details.

> [!note] Rewards
> 
> If the party assisted the witch successfully, she is now considered an ally. She offers two [potions of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md) to the party, with the promise of more potions in exchange for ingredients.

## Leaving the Reach

After dealing with the swamp witch, the party returns to Winnowing Reach. The Magistrate wants to hear about the excursion, and again invites the characters into his chambers for a private conference.

### If the party killed the witch

They can simply tell the truth. Walden will immediately ask for his proof; handing him the horn amulet will convince him of the party's deed and allow them to receive the promised reward of 5 gp per character, if agreed upon.

### If the party did not kill the witch and wishes to lie about it

One character must make a DC 11 Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check to pass off a suitable lie to the Magistrate. If they produce the horn amulet as proof, the character making the check rolls with advantage. If they do not have the amulet, they must account for why they don't have it in order for Walden to accept their story and reward them.

### If the party killed the witch, or convinced the Magistrate of such

Walden also produces the promised letter.

### If the party did not kill the witch, and tells the truth

The Magistrate responds furiously:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "You WHAT!?" Walden replies. "Don't you see that you have doomed our town? You are not the heroes I took you for. Take your things and leave."
^053

He refuses to pay any agreed upon bounty for the party's work, and will not write them their letter of introduction.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Should you require a letter of introduction," Walden begins, a sardonic look playing across his face, "why not try the Magistrate of Alderheart?" He gives a hollow chuckle. "Oath-breakers like yourselves will have much in common with that scoundrel."
^054

As the party prepares to depart, Eliza approaches, asking if she might travel alongside them to Alderheart. She welcomes both the company and protection offered by the party.

When the party is ready to leave, they can resume their journey to Alderheart to deliver Elder Ardwyn's message to the Council. The road to Alderheart leads northeast out of town, deeper into the forest.
