# Adventure in the Wood

*Source: Humblewood: Adventure in the Wood* 

a tale from the wood

## Introduction

The earth beneath Leya felt unusually warm. She reached down to confirm and pulled back in pain immediately. Her feathers were seared slightly. The season had been unusually dry, but this was a frightening temperature. After a closer look, it seemed like the ground was glowing.

CRACK! Leya's eyes went to the sound. The large tree she'd played in as a child had fallen, and smoke rose from its remains. "Go!" her mind yelled, and she listened, rushing towards home. "Get to them beforeâ€”"

Suddenly, flames burst forth, travelling at an unearthly velocity towards Leya's perch. Her perch meant the world to her, but in the vast expanse of the Wood it was small and unimportant. Too insignificant for a Perch Guard outpost of its own. Her heart tightened knowing the remote settlement wouldn't be warned in time, and that aid would not be close by.

Leya's hands began to move without thought as she whispered the words of her grandmother. It wouldn't be enough, but she wouldn't be able to live with herself if she didn't try. When taught to her, the spell was meant to help farms through rainless seasons. It wasn't intended to be used defensively. Droplets of a lost cause formed between her fingers.

Conjured water fell to the ground, evaporating as soon as it hit the steaming forest floor. As she concentrated, a strong warm gust touched Leya's face. It's Altus, it must be! Leya thought. The Amaranthine of storms was bringing rain to quench this hateful wildfire. She looked to the sky, frantically searching for more signs of changing weather.

Barely able to register what she saw, her arms dropped to her sides in defeat. Flying balls of fire were filling up the sky. A swarm broke off, headed in her direction. Leya sank to her knees, hoping with her last thoughts that someone would save Humblewood before it all burned.

The challenges in this adventure were created with a balanced party of four players in mind. If your group has more or fewer players, consider adding or removing enemies in each encounter. Try to ensure players feel challenged, but not overwhelmed. The adventure can be played through in its entirety, or used as pieces for your own custom campaign. "Appendix E: Random Encounters", as well as the **Monster Cards**, and **NPC Cards** can be used to further flesh out the game.

Humblewood lies on the eastern coast of a vast continent, nestled in a valley between the towering Crest Mountains and the marshlands of the Mokk Fields. It is a mystical, secluded place that gets by quite well without much trade from the outside world, due to the fertility of the soil and an abundance of natural resources. The Wood has many skilled workers and artisans, and this, coupled with the supply of raw materials, makes Humblewood a great exporter.

The Wood has a diverse population, but the true power in Humblewood are the birdfolk. At the heart of their nation lies the great capital of Alderheart. The seat of commerce, art, and political power in the region, Alderheart has long been a refuge for those seeking fame, fortune, or protection.

Players will encounter some locations that are not extensively explained in this chapter. It is recommended that the information in the "Traversing the Wood" chapter be used to help players understand their surroundings.

***Monster and NPC Cards.*** In addition to their entries in "Appendix A: Bestiary", all the monsters and NPCs exclusive to this adventure have accompanying *The Deck of Many* cards for quick reference.

***Character Advancement***. For ease of play, the adventure has been structured with the milestone leveling rules in mind. Characters will level up automatically at the end of key story moments. For those groups using the standard XP rewards, there are experience point rewards for the social, puzzle, and other non-combat encounters provided alongside the milestone rewards. Otherwise, award standard XP for defeated foes as the players progress through the adventure.

## Overview

There have been disturbing signs over the last few months, signalling that something is wrong in Humblewood. The troubles appear to originate from activity in the Scorched Grove, an ashen plain that was ravaged many centuries ago by a destructive fire. Whatever caused the fire has scarred the land with elemental magic, making it inhospitable to all but strange fire-based creatures. Of late, the Grove has begun to expand. At first, it was hard to notice the slow expansion, but those in tune with nature (especially the Tenders) could see the imbalance in the elemental forces of Humblewood. For many common folk, this imbalance has been experienced as unseasonal dryness, which has led to crop failure and an increased frequency of forest fires. There have also been a number of unusually aggressive emberbat clouds reported far outside of their natural ranges.

The true nature of the danger still remains hidden from the people of the Wood. A corvum necromancer named [Odwald Ebonhart](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/odwald-ebonhart-hwcs.md) has stirred the elemental [aspect of fire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/aspect-of-fire-hwcs.md), which has lain dormant beneath the Scorched Grove since its first burning. The aspect's energies have begun to empower fire-based creatures within the Wood. The increased range of emberbat swarms have brought fires that have expanded the Grove. Many forest-dwellers, who have been left without homes, have turned to banditry to survive. Soon the elemental incarnation will break free, and players must find a way to stop the aspect of fire before it reduces the Wood to ashes.
