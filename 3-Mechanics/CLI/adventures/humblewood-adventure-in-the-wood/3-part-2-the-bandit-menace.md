# Part 2: The Bandit Menace
*Source: Humblewood: Adventure in the Wood, p. 101* 

a story of strife and fire

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/adventure/HWAitW/Part-2.webp#center)

This part of the adventure introduces one of the greatest forces threatening the Wood: the Bandit Coalition, which has risen up and gained power since the fires first began to spread. The Coalition's membership is comprised mostly of humblefolk who, because of the fires, have been displaced from small villages deep in the Wood. Their homes are generally less fortified than the birdfolk perches, and while humblefolk refugees have sought shelter within Alderheart, many were refused entry due to overcrowding, and have turned to a life of banditry to sustain themselves.

The Coalition now represents a serious threat to the Wood, owing to the leadership of a scarred cervan warrior named [Benna Seridan](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/benna-seridan-hwcs.md). Benna's mission is one of revenge against the Birdfolk Council at Alderheart, but she also seeks to support all the forest-dwellers who were displaced by the fires, many of whom now serve in the Coalition. The party must defend Alderheart from the Bandit Coalition, and will later be asked by the Council to help strike a decisive blow against the bandit menace.

## A Rough Road Ahead

After their trials at Winnowing Reach, characters will continue to make their way toward Alderheart to seek an audience with the Birdfolk Council, possibly with Eliza in tow. The road to the capital is long, requiring three days of travel. Be sure to have Eliza or another NPC from Winnowing Reach remind the party to properly stock up before they depart. They can find any supplies they might need for their journey (rations, bedrolls, and the like) at the local general store.

> [!note] The Wood is Burning
> 
> By this point, the party should have some idea of the effects of the fires on the Wood and its citizens. Provide more context as the party continues their travels by describing scorched sections of the forest on the horizons, or the remains of burnt-down woodland villages.
> 
> These themes can be expanded upon by selecting encounters from the Road Encounters table (such as emberbats, or bandits) to further illustrate the depth of the chaos caused by the spreading fires. 
^the-wood-is-burning

Roll a `d20` for each day of travel, and on a roll of 5 or lower, roll again on the Road Encounters table. To add more random encounters, roll a `d20` every four hours of travel. Alternatively, have the party skip straight to Alderheart.

In each encounter, if accompanied by Eliza, she will do her best to stay out of danger, hiding behind her cart and relying on the party to protect her and her wares.

**Road Encounters**

`dice: [](3-part-2-the-bandit-menace.md#^road-encounters)`

| dice: d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | `2d4` [mapach bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md) ambush the party. |
| 2 | `1d2` [swarms of emberbats](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-emberbats-hwcs.md) attack the party. |
| 3 | `1d3` [magmin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/magmin.md) can be spotted burning foliage through the trees. They haven't started a fire yet, but they will if left unchecked. |
| 4 | A [giant elk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-elk.md) appears in a peaceful glade, drinking from a mysterious pond with an abundance of plant life. There is a sense of calm and serenity here. Each character that stops to drink from the pond heals `1d4 + 2` hit points. |
| 5 | `1d4 + 1` [mapach bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md) and a [jerbeen thief](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-thief-hwcs.md) spring from the forest, offering safe passage for a road toll of 3 gp per party member. They will attack if the toll is not paid immediately. |
| 6 | A traveling [gallus druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gallus-druid-hwcs.md) is met on the road. She has a calm demeanour and will inform the party of "The Tenders", an organization to which she belongs. She has two bags of poultice that she will sell for 15 gp apiece. Each can be applied to a wound to heal `1d4 + 2` hit points. |
| 7 | A small pool of water giving off mist can be seen in a clearing. Disturbing the pool reveals that the mist is actually steam and the water is scalding. `1d4 + 1` [steam mephits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/steam-mephit.md) appear and attack immediately. |
| 8 | A bandit's net trap has been laid across the trail and covered with leaves. It can be spotted with a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. If characters walk into it, the trap springs, and characters must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to avoid getting caught. On a failure, you can roll on this table again to complicate the encounter. |

## The Great Tree City

If traveling with Eliza, read this:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> After a few hours of travel, Eliza abruptly sets her cart down where the road winds around an immense tree trunk. The tree is so large its branches block out sunlight for at least a mile. "Well, this is it! We've finally arrived at Alderheart!" She gestures upward to a network of platforms and bridges in the canopy above. Closer inspection of the tree shows rough steps carved into the trunk. At a distance, these steps are almost impossible to spot.
^05a

If Eliza is not around to guide the party, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> After a few hours of travel, the road winds around an enormous tree whose branches block out the sunlight for at least a mile. Looking up, in the canopy you can see a system of pulleys which lead to networks of platforms and bridges. Closer inspection of the tree reveals hidden steps carved into the massive trunk. You have reached Alderheart, the Great Tree City.
^05b

### A Bustling Metropolis

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You and your companions emerge from the winding stairway up the trunk into a canopy filled with the bustle of city life. Buildings are located within the foliage, and crowded roadways are sculpted from the giant branches. The roadways are connected with rope, wood bridges, and carefully postioned platforms made of timber. Birdfolk guards, known colloquially as "the Perch Guard," can be seen keeping watch throughout the city. Laborers operate pulley systems that are used to raise carts to the canopy platforms.
^05d

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/adventure/HWAitW/Part-2-2.webp#center)

For more details about the city, refer to the description of Alderheart in "Chapter 3: Traversing the Wood". All the usual amenities of a large city can be found here. Refer to Fig. 2.1 for a map of Alderheart.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/adventure/HWAitW/Alderheart.webp#center)

### 1. Council Plaza

The upper levels of Alderheart's canopy can be reached by a stairway near the canopy market that leads up through a massive central pillar. This is where all judicial and government buildings related to the oversight of Alderheart and Humblewood can be found. Here, characters can find the Birdfolk Council Chambers, a large domed structure nestled within the branches. Next to it, there is a courthouse, a gaol, and the Perch Guard Headquarters. All of these buildings are arranged around an open plaza containing a large statue of a sera luma dressed in ceremonial robes. This is an effigy of Speaker Ava, the Founder of the Birdfolk Council.

### 2. Canopy Market

This busy market in the canopy is where characters can find high quality wares and imported goods from beyond Humblewood. Talented weaponsmiths, armorers, and merchants of all sorts do business here. There are also shops on the outskirts with truly unique wares. Eliza's Emporium is located in the canopy market, a little ways off from the main thoroughfare.

### 3. The Boughs

An affluent neighborhood of high class homes. Many of Alderheart's aristocrats and high ranking city officials have residences here.

### 4. The Branches

A neighborhood made of modest homes, connected by wood bridges and gliding platforms. This area is dangerous for non-birdfolk. Without the ability to glide, a fall from here is almost certainly fatal.

### 5. Trunk Market

Lately, the number of folks residing in the trunk section has swelled due to villagers escaping the fires. A hollow space, just a few minutes walk from the trunk's market, has become a shelter area for refugees, much to the dismay of local merchants. The market area is overcrowded, and many refugees are searching for work, begging for alms, or taking to thievery to support themselves.

### 6. The Bright Hollows

This part of the trunk is known for a series of holes within the bark that allow natural light to stream in. The trunk contains many of the common homes and markets in Alderheart, and the majority of those who live there are humblefolk. Some pathways here lead to dwellings on the outside of the tree, which are nicer than the simplet homes that can be found inside the trunk.

### 7. The Underfall

The roots are the slums of Alderheart, and within these shabby tunnels characters will see destitute refugees and communities of locals living in poverty. This is the best place to find criminal contacts within the city, as well as fences who can help characters sell restricted goods or purchase them at a heavily inflated price.

### Seeing the Sights

Characters should be given an opportunity to rest after their journey, and be encouraged to explore the city.

## Eliza's Emporium

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/adventure/HWAitW/Elizas-Emporium.webp#center)

> [!note] Using the map of Eliza's Emporium
> 
> Though it is unlikely that an interaction in Eliza's shop will result in combat, a map of her emporium is provided to show what the interior of a common Humblewood shop or home might look like.
^using-the-map-of-elizas-emporium

If Eliza accompanied the characters, a day or more has passed since arriving to Alderheart, Eliza will find the party and let them know where her new storefront is located. She is taking over an old shop on the edge of the canopy market, the same one her sister used to manage. Visiting the shop now, the characters will find that it looks a little run down compared to the others nearby, but Eliza is determined to make her business a success. Should the party return after the next few encounters, she will have it looking almost new. Refer to Fig. 2.2 for a map of Eliza's Emporium.

If the party helped Eliza along her journey she will remember their kindness and offer them a 10% discount on purchases, and an extra 10% when selling to her. While always friendly and welcoming, if a character ever deeply offends Eliza, she will refuse them service. Those looking to get back in her good graces may find success by offering a unique item as an apology.

### Goods for Sale

In addition to adventuring essentials, Eliza prides herself on stocking one-of-a-kind items and treasures. She is a consummate capitalist and always knows how to properly value an item. Her rare goods usually come with large price tags.

Eliza's stock consists of basic adventuring gear, along with a collection of strange and unique goods found in her travels. At first, her wares are sparse, but more items may be added to the shop as the story unfolds and Eliza becomes more established in the city. The below tables can also be rolled on to randomize the wondrous items Eliza has managed to acquire. All magic items listed here can be found in the 5th Edition Core Rules.

> [!note] Magic Items That Reference Character Races
> 
> Typical fantasy races (elves, dwarves, halflings, orcs and the like) aren't native to the world of Everden, but instead of keeping magic items that reference these races out of your campaign, it is recommended that you find a way to incorporate them in ways that fit with the races available in the Humblewood setting. For example, the [cloak of elvenkind](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cloak-of-elvenkind.md) allows its wearer to camouflage with their surroundings, much like the Patterned Feathers ability possessed by strigs, so it could be called the cloak of strigkind instead.

## The Birdfolk Council

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Walking towards the Council Chambers, you can see a huge domed structure rising up through the foliage. The building is cradled into the natural curve of Alderheart's giant trunk. A large platform has been built around the imposing structure, connecting it to the branch-roads that run throughout the city. It is adorned with brightly-colored banners displaying crests of the major settlements of the Wood. Two guards in resplendent armor stand watch at the entrance, turning away those who do not have permission to enter. A throng of people mill about nearby.
^06b

Without a letter of introduction, the guards will ask the party to register their pleas at the local magistrate's office and wait for their request to be approved (see The Magistrate of Alderheart).

With a letter of introduction from a magistrate, the guards watching the entrance will verify the paperwork (skip The Magistrate of Alderheart, and see Audience with the Council).

### The Magistrate of Alderheart

When the party enters the Magistrate's office they find [Gregor Thornspur, Magistrate of Alderheart](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gregor-thornspur-magistrate-of-alderheart-hwcs.md), sitting at his desk.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Ashbarrow has burned to the ground? You don't say!" The Magistrate looks down at his papers as he strokes his chin. "Now, that is important. Unfortunately, I am bound by my office to be fair, so your news will have to wait, just like everyone else. I recommend you make yourselves comfortable and enjoy the splendor of the city." After a short pause, Gregor raises his head and continues, "But, if you are interested, and are willing to hear me out, I might 'accidentally' submit your request ahead of the others. These things do happen, you know."
^06d

If the party agrees to help, the Magistrate will tell them about a group of jerbeens that have been causing trouble around the trunk's market district. People down there have been filing complaints, and he would like to see the matter dealt with. Supposing the party can ensure Gregor never has to hear about this problem again, he'll grant them an early audience with the Council.

You can have the party come up with their own solution for finding the jerbeens, but if they're stuck, advise them that asking around the market might be an easy way to locate them. Inquiring around the market will require a DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, which will lead the party straight to the jerbeen hideout on a success. A failure will require another hour of searching before coming across someone who knows where the hideout is.

There are four jerbeens, all of them siblings. Their parents died when their village was consumed by a forest fire, and they've been stealing to survive ever since. The eldest uses the stat block for a [jerbeen thief](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-thief-hwcs.md). The other three, being far less skilled, use the stat block for a [bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md), but halve the bandit's hit points (add jerbeen traits to these NPCs if desired). They are all armed with [daggers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/dagger.md) and [slings](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sling.md).

The party can attempt to persuade the thieves to stop stealing and find another means to support themselves. A DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check will convince them their current lifestyle is too dangerous, but it won't solve their problems. Have the characters roleplay to find a solution. Any character with a background that grants them connections to a temple, business, or other such institutions in the city could likely help the jerbeen orphans secure work.

The party can give the young thieves some gold, solving their financial problems temporarily. Any amount of gold will help them for a time: five gold pieces will provide the siblings enough security to look for honest work, while a payment of one gold piece could result in the jerbeens resorting to stealing again, once the gold runs out. In the latter situation, the characters may cross paths with the Magistrate later, at which point he will report that "The thieves are at it again!"

The orphans can also simply be fought. If one or more of them are reduced to 0 hit points, the rest will flee. This humbling experience could result in them aligning with the bandits to survive. The Magistrate may never hear from the orphans again, but the party might meet the jerbeen orphans again during an encounter with bandits.

Whatever the party decides to do, after confirming the player's actions through some of his connections in the city, the Magistrate will tell the party they can expect to have their audience granted the following day.

### Audience with the Council

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The guard to your left roughly grabs the paperwork. "Let me see that." After giving the scroll a very thorough readthrough, the guard moves to the side, stiffens his back, and gestures towards the door. "Everything is in order here. Please join the other petitioners waiting to be summoned."
> 
> After waiting for what feels like an eternity, another guard loudly calls your names and instructs you to enter the chambers.
> 
> As you pass through the double doors into the Council Chambers, you see a group of five stately birdfolk arranged across elevated seats. Each council member has a tall podium in front of them, rising to just above their waist. A sheaf of papers is ordered neatly upon each podium. A circular aperture in the center of the ceiling allows sunlight to shine in. A wise-looking bright gallus raises a talon in greeting and addresses your party: "You now stand in the presence of the Birdfolk Council. I am the Council's Speaker, Bita. Please, state your case."
^06f

Overseen by [Bita, the Council Speaker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/bita-the-council-speaker-hwcs.md), the Council is the ruling body of Humblewood. The Council has the authority to draft laws that affect the entire Wood.

The members of the Council will gladly hear the party out. Despite the dignity and formality with which they hold themselves, each Council member cares deeply for the people of the Wood. They will listen carefully to the woes Meadowfen is facing, and will be saddened to hear of Ashbarrow's destruction. If there are any other issues the party wishes to recount to the Council, they will hear these as well.

Use this pool of information to inform the Council's behavior:

- The Council is aware of the spreading fires, but their primary concern is banditry jeopardizing the big city and essential trading hubs. The bandit ranks have swelled of late, and the Perch Guard can only be spread so thin.  
- The bandits have been rallied by a fearsome leader, making them bolder than ever. Little is known about this leader, but the Council has been able to corroborate that she is a ruthless cervan female, named Benna Seridan, who holds a great hatred for Alderheart.  
- The Council knows that Alderheart could support more refugees, but they prefer to remain cautious in these difficult times. The fires keep spreading, after all. If all the refugees are allowed to enter, how long before the city runs out of food and other essential resources?  
- The Council can decide to confer among themselves and meet with the party again tomorrow afternoon, to see what aid they can afford to send to Meadowfen. They assure the party that aid will be sent, but ask for their patience during these trying times. Sending a cart of supplies along bandit-ridden roads will not be easy, and any guards they send as an escort will mean less protection for the Alderites.  

## Bandits Attack

After the meeting with the Birdfolk Council, in the middle of the night, the following happens:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A city-wide alarm sounds, rousing the Perch Guard to their posts. Following the commotion, you see a great deal of movement around the northern entrance to Alderheart. There are shouts of "Bandits!" all around, and something about a merchant caravan arriving at the city.
^071

***If the party decides to check out the scene,*** they will arrive at a platform in front of the northernmost city gate. There they will be faced with a dismal scene: several wagons are being besieged by a massive bandit force. If the characters are armed or wearing armor, the guard captain will beseech them to help repel the bandits.

Below, a handful of bandit captains are barking orders at dozens of bandits attacking the caravans. Though the party may want to leap right into the fray, be sure to emphasize the danger involved. While ranged combat might help provide support for the sparse Perch Guard infantry, any character that throws themselves into the melee will soon be overwhelmed.

There are many ways characters could provide support for the sparse Perch Guard infantry. Examples include rallying the scattered Perch Guard with a heartening display, or cutting the ropes on the pulley system or freight elevators to create makeshift cover for Alderheart's forces to crouch behind. Encourage players to come up with their own creative solutions.

After two or three party members have helped stem the assault, the brigands will start to flee, spilling armfuls of plundered treasure as they escape. At this point, the bandit horde will be small enough that the Perch Guard can go on the offensive, and characters can attempt to enter melee combat. If they do, have them encounter a [vulpin captain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vulpin-captain-hwcs.md), still trying to keep the bandit forces organized. A one-on-one fight with a character might be appropriate, but if the whole party joins in, add two [mapach bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md) or a single [jerbeen thief](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-thief-hwcs.md). The downfall of these foes marks the complete rout of the bandit forces.

***If no characters go into melee combat,*** the Perch Guard will run the bandits out of the city and into the Wood.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Spears, arrows, and even rocks thrown from slings rain down upon the bandit horde. Laden with the spoils of their raid, the bandits struggle to fight and begin to retreat. A victorious cry goes up along the wall, but the captain of the Perch Guard gazes down at the razed and ramshackled caravan with a look of steely determination. "We have wounded down there," she exclaims, rallying the troops. "Send for healers!"
^072

The bandits have taken all they can carry and fled into the northern forest. The scene left in their wake is one of broken merchant carts and wounded people. Birdfolk and humblefolk alike are injured and frightened. Characters can join in the relief effort, helping to carry the injured up the tree for treatment, or assist the shocked travelers to the safety of the canopy. A character who can provide medical aid with skills, tools, or spells may also do so.

As the wounds of the injured are being tended, the guard captain will immediately begin organizing a counterattack, hoping to press the bandits back to their hideout and snuff out the threat for good.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "This cannot be allowed to continue!" the captain shouts, swinging up on a nearby branch to make herself visible to the crowd. "These bandits strike at our home, at our livelihood, and at our dignity as citizens of the Wood. Well, I say no more! The time has come for us to stop this menace, once and for all! Who's with me!?"
^073

The party should be encouraged to join the growing force of guards, militia, and common folk getting ready to leave for the bandit camp. The captain will applaud the party if they volunteer, and single them out to the jeers of the crowd if they try to refuse. Be sure that the captain advises the party to heal if they are wounded, as the bandit camp is heavily fortified and they will meet with strong resistance.

## Taking the Fight to Them

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/adventure/HWAitW/Bandit-Camp-DM.webp#center)

> [!gallery]
> ![Bandit Camp battlemap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/adventure/HWAitW/Bandit-Camp.webp#gallery)

The bandits, loaded down with stolen goods, leave an obvious trail. They have become brash and sloppy, leading the guard captain and her troops directly to their camp. The camp is a collection of canvas tents and a few hastily-constructed storehouses behind fortified palisades. There is a large central tent that appears to be for the leader of the camp. Refer to Fig. 2.3 for a map of the Bandit Camp.

> [!note] Using the Bandit Camp map
> 
> Depending on how players approach the bandit camp, have them enter at either point marked with a white "X." The bandits attack in two stages, as indicated by the numbered creatures shown on the map. The diagram provides suggested positions for each stage to enter the fight. [Fray Merridan](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/fray-merridan-hwcs.md), her wolf, and a jerbeen lieutenant are hiding in the tent, as indicated. If playing with tokens or miniatures, consider keeping Fray and her group off the map until their pres-ence is revealed.
^using-the-bandit-camp-map

The party is joined by a number of birdfolk who are anxious to put an end to the raids. Utilize the [birdfolk guard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-guard-hwcs.md), [birdfolk skirmisher](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-skirmisher-hwcs.md), [birdfolk militia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-militia-hwcs.md), and [birdfolk farmer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/birdfolk-farmer-hwcs.md) stat blocks to fill in the fighting force. For narrative purposes, have these characters fight in the background, adding tension and color to the encounter. Some of them can join the party's fight if it looks like the characters could use help. Slot them in at the start of the round for the purposes of determining initiative.

There is also a lone [strig knight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/strig-knight-hwcs.md) fighting among the Alderites. He is a mighty ally, and the party should notice him displaying his skill and prowess during the fight, perhaps even diverting the flow of battle so that the party can deal with their encounters without interference from more experienced bandits. The knight is [Riffin, the Ash-Knight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/riffin-the-ash-knight-hwcs.md), an NPC players can choose to seek out after the battle. Whether or not a character speaks to Riffin after the battle, Riffin will join the story at a later juncture. It is advised to not have him help the party directly unless they are in dire need, as he can easily overpower any of the challenges faced here.

The moment the two sides meet, fighting will immediately break out between the Perch Guard and the bandits. If at any time the encounter seems too easy, add an extra [mapach bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md).

The bandits attack in stages. Roll initiative for all creatures involved in both stages, but only have the second group engage once the first group has been dealt with. The attack stages are as follows:

### Stage 1: Attack now, think later

Out of the greenery rush five [mapach bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md). There is nothing elegant about the attack. Success in numbers seems to be the battleplan.

### Stage 2: "A" is for arrows and arbalist

Schhwaff! An arrow wizzes by and embeds itself in the earth near one of the defeated bandits. Before the arbalist can be located, two [jerbeen thieves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-thief-hwcs.md) fall from the branches above. Jumping around wildly, the jerbeens will attempt to disarm and distract the party. Two [mapach bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md) with crossbows, using camp tents as cover, provide ranged support for the thieves.

### Leader of the Bandits

When the party starts to get the bandits under control, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The chaos of battle surrounds you. Birdfolk militia clash with bandits. Some, merely farmers with pitchforks, are not faring as well as the trained guards. A swift defeat of the bandit leader will surely save many lives.
^079

If by some happenstance Fray was killed or captured, skip the below text and replace her with another vulpin captain. The bandit leader will single out the party as the primary threat and decide to take them on.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you approach the largest tent, you see a familiar figure exit, along with a retainer and a trained wolf. She greets you with a sneer, "You again!" The tall, graceful vulpin leader of this bandit camp is none other than Fray Merridan! "It's time I finished you once and for all." Fray draws her sword with a flourish, pointing it at you and your companions. "You shall have the honor of witnessing my deadly grace before you die."
^07a

This time, Fray will attack along with her [wolf](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/wolf.md) animal companion, and a rough-looking [jerbeen thief](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-thief-hwcs.md). The thief has a scrap of cloth covering one of her eyes and one ear that looks like it's been cut with a knife. Fray and her retainer both have magical items:

- Fray has come into possession of a magical brooch, which grants her resistance to all force damage and immunity to the [magic missile](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/magic-missile.md) spell.  
- The jerbeen thief is wearing magic boots. She can click her heels together as a bonus action to double her walking speed and, for the rest of the fight, cause [opportunity attacks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#opportunity%20attack) made against her to have disadvantage.  

Fray will target whoever she fought in her first encounter with the party before battling the rest of the characters. There will be no attempts at self-preservation this time. The Coalition is counting on Fray to defend the camp, and she will not desert her post. Fray will command her wolf and the thief to attack the same target, but if Fray is heavily injured she will call the animal to her aid.

It isn't magical, but of obvious craftsmanship, and will sell for double the normal going rate for a [shortsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shortsword.md). Any lower level bandit who sees a character wearing it will also immediately recognize it as a captain's sword, giving them disadvantage on any rolls made to oppose Charisma ([Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) ability checks made by that character against them.

### The Rest Scatter

After their leader is dispatched, the remainder of the bandit forces flee in any direction they can.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> With their leader nowhere in sight, and Alderheart's forces bearing down on them, any semblance of order among the bandits disintegrates. They begin to flee in every direction, taking what they can, and abandoning the camp. A cry of victory rises from the assembled citizens. The day is won, but at a heavy cost.
^07d

The bulk of the bandit force appears to be heading east, toward The Crest. The guards, beaten and exhausted, cannot give chase. The guards bandage up the injured and rest briefly before preparing the fallen for transport back to Alderheart.

With the camp abandoned by the bandits, the party can take their time searching the camp.

During a search of the camp, a few captive birdfolk will be found. These hostages are the villagers from Meadowfen. Taken as ransom, they are a little malnourished but otherwise fine. The captain of the guard promises that she will ensure the Medofenners get to Alderheart safely and, once they are well enough to travel, provide them with an escort back to Meadowfen.

> [!note] Treasure
> 
> In the storage buildings near the camp's rear entrance the party finds an assortment of stolen goods, much of it from the day's raid on the merchant caravan:
> 
> - A chest of coins, with a combined value of 350 gp.  
> - A collection of small gemstones pried from various objects, with a combined value of 250 gp.  
> - A variety of gold and silver plated urns, plates, and utensils, with a combined value of 200 gp.  
^treasure

### Returning Victorious

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Leaving the traces of battle behind, the remainder of the Perch Guard and militia return to Alderheart. Honoring their sacrifice, the fallen are transported at the front of the somber parade back to the city. Those who cannot carry themselves are carried on makeshift stretchers while the injured are helped along the trail home. Despite heavy losses, you and your companions are welcomed back to Alderheart as heroes.
^080

Upon returning to Alderheart, the party is summoned to an emergency meeting of the Birdfolk Council. The Captain of the Perch Guard commends the party for their bravery and skill, but the Council urgently demands to hear about the bandits. The Council asks many questions about the bandits: their numbers, their tactics, which way they fled, and how many were injured. It is clear the Council fears reinforcements may be nearby.

One Council member asks if any personal items were found at the camp, explaining that over the past few months goods and possessions have gone missing. Should the party be honest about what they found in the camp, they will be allowed to keep any recovered magical items for their effort, as well as half of the value of treasure they recovered from the bandit camp.

It is also an option to keep their treasure a secret, requiring a DC 15 Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check. On a success, the party is taken at their word. On a failure, the Council member who posed the question distrusts them, but the rest of the Council will side with the party in this dispute, at least for now.

The Birdfolk Council, not knowing the location of the bandit's hoard, will conduct an inquiry in the coming days.

## The Coming Storm

With the bandits dealt with for now, life quiets down a bit around Alderheart. This is a good opportunity for the characters to further explore the city and resolve plot threads or character hooks.

The razing of the bandit camp was a huge blow to the morale of the Bandit Coalition, and should the party wander around the city, the Alderites will make them feel that their actions have had an enormous impact. Roughly a week's downtime is reasonable. Shorten or extend the quiet period depending on side quests. As soon as the party seems ready, skip to Council Summons.

### Bandit Interrogation

If any of the party members are curious or would like to pursue leads on the bandit threat, they will find out that Fray (if she is still alive) and any bandits the militia rounded up are being held in the Alderheart gaol.

At the gaol, the characters may question Fray or another bandit to persuade them to reveal the location of the bandit's mountain stronghold. The interviewee is initially tight-lipped, but if either goaded with a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check or bluffed with a DC 14 Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check, they will reveal the stronghold's exact location in the Crest. Sometimes there is more than one way to open a lock, and the players may be able to find other avenues to acquire this information. Either way, the captive's position is simple:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The prisoner scoffs, then says snidely, "So, you know where our base is. It won't do you any good. Our people have suffered while the Council sits by and does nothing. A reckoning is coming to Alderheart."
^084

Once the Birdfolk Council learns that the location of the bandit stronghold has been revealed, it won't take them long to summon the party and ask for their assistance in dealing with the stronghold once and for all. Hopefully, action can be taken before the bandits can unleash whatever they're planning for Alderheart.

### Seeking out the Ash-Knight

Should the party want to seek the Ash-Knight out, Riffin can be found at the Wooden Flagon. The Wooden Flagon is a tavern near the trunk's market district where Riffin has been staying. It won't be too hard to locate him, especially if the party speaks with any of the guards, militia, or birdfolk who fought in the assault on the bandit camp. Riffin's gallant efforts against the bandits have made him the talk of the town, and he has had many visitors since the victory.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You see before you a small yet sturdy looking strig clad head to talon in heavy armor, sitting at the bar with a flagon of ale. He wears a shield emblazoned with a wing crest on his back and a sheathed sword on his belt. He regards you with a friendly look as you approach. "Well, hullo, how'dya do?"
^086

Riffin is friendly, and will gladly share his story. He is from Ashbarrow and was only able to escape the recent destruction of his village thanks to the help of his good friend [Odwald Ebonhart](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/odwald-ebonhart-hwcs.md), who brought him here. Riffin and Odwald have been adventuring buddies for a long time. The morning before the bandits raided the merchant caravan outside Alderheart's gates, Riffin awoke to find Odwald gone without a word. He was looking for his friend when the violence began, but he couldn't stand idly by while bandits attacked the city. Now that he's confirmed Odwald is no longer in Alderheart, Riffin is preparing to leave on a journey to find Odwald. He has some idea of where the old bird might've gone.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I owe Odwald, even if he might not accept it. Maybe it's strange, but I just know he's got himself into 'sumthin'. He needs my help. What sorta friend would I be if I abandoned him?"
^087

Riffin will politely decline any requests from the party asking for his help in dealing with the bandits. His duty now is to his friend. If the party offers to help Riffin look for Odwald, the strig will thank them kindly, but insist that both as a knight and a friend it is his duty alone to pursue this. He knows Odwald well, and Riffin is certain he'll find his friend at one of their old haunts.

As the party leaves the tavern, Riffin will wish them luck on their travels. If the party tries to locate Riffin once they get back from the stronghold, they'll find he has already left the city.

### Council Summons

If the party was unsuccessful at holding an audience with the Birdfolk Council and relaying Ardwyn's message, the party may relay that message at this meeting with the Birdfolk Council (see Audience with the Council).

To guarantee the characters meet with the Alderheart Birdfolk Council, have a messenger or guard present them with an immediate summons to the Council Chambers. There, during a brief meeting, the party can be presented with the task of dealing with the bandit stronghold.

Having fled after the defeat at their forest camp, many bandits have returned to their stronghold in the Crest. This fortress is capable of withstanding a large-scale attack, and its position in the mountains makes it a dangerous location to assault. The Council has seen fit to ask the adventurers to flush out the bandit leadership once and for all, finally ridding Humblewood of their thievery and brutality. Given a major encounter would prove disastrous, the Council calls on the heroes to use their proven skills to infiltrate the fortress and dispatch the leader of the Bandit Coalition: Benna Seridan.

## Approaching the Bandit Stronghold

The Crest Mountains are located roughly five days away from the capital. The party must travel through the forest before they can begin their ascent of the Crest. For the sake of pacing, choose to simply start the party at the foot of the mountains. Given the importance of their mission, it's reasonable that Alderheart would send an entourage of guards to escort the party to the base of the mountain, which would provide sufficient protection to eliminate the risk of encounters.

If the group consists of players who enjoy the experience of traveling across open country with their characters, use the Road Encounters table, or the [Forest Encounters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/appendix-e-random-encounters-forest-encounters-level-1-2-hwcs.md) table to provide some color to the journey. However they choose to arrive there, players will be greeted by a majestic sight:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The jagged slopes of the Crest tower before you, their peaks obscured by clouds. There is but a single path ahead. The daunting ascent up the mountain looks to be the only way to reach the summit and the bandit stronghold.
^08a

The crags and canyons of the Crest would be enough to deter even the most hardened explorers, and the ascent to the fortress will take time, roughly two days of travel up the steep mountain road. If the party has an escort, the escort will leave them at the base of the mountain and return to Alderheart.

Along the way, the party will need to contend with rock slides, [mountain lions](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/mountain-lion-hwcs.md), and bandit patrols.

The mountain climb can be fast-tracked by having at least one member of the party make a DC 14 Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check each day, skipping the day's encounter and potentially reaching the fortress without incident. On a failure, have the party deal with an encounter from the Mountain Road Encounters table. The paths that lead up the Crest are narrow and weave between craggy outcrops (perfect for ambushes), or along sheer cliffs (perfect for traps), but it would be appropriate to create other terrain hazards for a given encounter.

**Mountain Road Encounters**

^mountain-road-encounters

### Bandit Patrols

To maintain the secrecy and security of the fortress, the bandits regularly patrol the paths. These patrols are comprised primarily of three [mapach bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md) and two [jerbeen thieves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-thief-hwcs.md), but if the party has been spotted by patrols at any point, add a [vulpin captain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vulpin-captain-hwcs.md) to the encounter.

## The Bandit Stronghold

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Finally, through the mist you see a pair of great stone towers looming on the horizon. As you approach, you notice they are connected to a squat and sturdy fortress, which stands in lonely vigil among the crags. A few distant shapes can be seen patrolling the parapets, and banners with the crest of the Bandit Coalition hang proudly from the walls.
^08d

Entering the fortress proper will be a challenge. It has 100-foot-high stone walls with guard posts stationed around the perimeter. Behind the perimeter, the fortress opens into a square, 120-foot-long inner courtyard consisting of barracks and training areas. A narrow wagon-road leads from the north of the courtyard to a wooden palisade with a set of double doors. Beyond that, a meeting hall has been dug into the mountain itself, and serves as the inner keep.

Connecting the courtyard to the outside is a single large entrance on the front wall: a massive wooden door behind an iron portcullis, which can be lowered like a drawbridge for wagons. A smaller, 5-foot-wide door to the side allows for single-file entry and is guarded by two well-armored mapachs who are big for their kind. These two each use the stat block for a [mapach bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md), but with the following changes:

- They have 21 HP each  
- They have a Strength score of 14 (an additional +1 to attack rolls)  
- They are wearing [chain mail](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/chain-mail.md) (AC 16)  
- They are wielding [greataxes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/greataxe.md) (`1d12 + 2` damage per hit)  

Storming this entrance will almost certainly raise an alarm and incur attacks from the four archers walking the walls (use the stat block for a [mapach bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md)). The archers each benefit from three-quarters cover thanks to the parapets. Even though the stat block of the mapach bandit can be used for many of the least-skilled members of the camp, they come from a variety of humblefolk races. Hedges, cervans, jerbeens, and vulpins can all be found within their ranks.

> [!note] Captured!
> 
> There are many ways things could go badly for a party of adventurers here. If by chance they are overwhelmed by bandits, remember that Benna won't necessarily want them dead. She'll want to question them first, so the party will be placed in the fortress' prison until she's satisfied she has the answers she wants. If Benna has any reason to believe some of the characters are valuable hostages, she'll happily keep them alive in order to ransom them to the Birdfolk Council at Alderheart and continue filling the Coalition's coffers. If any of the party members are humblefolk, she might even try to convince them to join the Coalition. Birdfolk have had power in these lands for too long. If the character accepts her offer, once her plan to get revenge on the Council is complete, she'll be sure they share in the spoils.
^captured

### Finding a Way In

If there are any humblefolk in the party, and the party managed to get their hands on bandit outfits (either by taking some with them from the bandits defeated near Alderheart or from defeated bandit patrols on their way up the mountainside), those characters can easily disguise themselves and bluff their way into the fortress. The bandit ranks have grown steadily over the last few months, and new arrivals to the fortress are common. A birdfolk can attempt to bluff their way in, but this will be a little more challenging, requiring a DC 14 Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check to fool the bandits. A few "odd birds" have sided with the bandits, but their numbers are low enough to make the guards suspicious. Unless they are being introduced as "prisoners" rounded up by the humblefolk, birdfolk characters infiltrating the base will need to be careful of catching Benna's eye. They will face immediate suspicion from her if they are noticed.

> [!note] The Captain's Sword
> 
> Any character wearing Fray's sword will have advantage on Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) checks needed to enter the stronghold, as the sword denotes a captain's rank in the Coalition, and the sentries won't want to risk offending a ranking officer. While there aren't many bandits here who would recognize it as Fray's sword, any character openly wearing this weapon will need to be careful around Benna. She knows her captains well, and this will draw immediate suspicion.
^the-captains-sword

While the fortress walls are high, they are still surmountable with at least 100 feet of rope and a [grappling hook](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/grappling-hook.md), but the party will need to approach this option with caution. Spending a few hours on a stakeout will reveal the guard patrol patterns well enough to attempt to infiltrate the fortress with advantage on the DC 15 group Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check required to avoid the sentries. Stealthier parties may be able to slip in unnoticed without such preparation.

In addition to the above options, the party could choose a number of other routes to gain entry. Below are some possible options that would open a path to Benna:

- ***Creating a distraction,*** like setting a fire or sounding an alarm, that would pull the guards away from their posts.  
- ***Causing a scene outside the fortress or in the courtyard,*** goading Benna to come out and fight. She will accept the terms of single combat, but the party will need to abide by the results and be prepared to be taken as hostages if they lose (see The Prison). If another party member attempts to interfere, she'll set the camp on them (see Entering By Force).  
- ***If the party stakes out the fortress,*** they'll find that wagons with stolen goods make regular shipments up to the keep. The party could create a distraction, then sneak into one of these wagons and enter the keep undetected (see The Storeroom).  
- ***If characters encountered the jerbeen orphans in Alderheart, and treated them fairly,*** the orphans can turn up in the fortress as insider allies. They don't like the methods the bandits use, but they will mention that Benna is kind and has provided for all of the folks here, many of whom lost their homes to the fires.  

> [!note] Fighting to the Boss
> 
> The party can always choose to simply try to fight their way into the fortress, but it isn't recommended. It might not be too hard for them to force their way past the outer walls and into the courtyard, but from there, resistance will only increase (see Entering By Force). If the characters are getting in over their heads, have Benna appear early to fight them without having too many smaller confrontations.
^fighting-to-the-boss

## The Courtyard

The wide courtyard contains a small community of humblefolk, some wearing arms and armor, others unarmed and going about their day. There are two buildings inside the walls, as well as a narrow road leading up to the meeting hall. A few points of interest can be seen here:

- The largest building is the wooden barracks to the east. It has rows of target dummies at the front. Depending on the time of day the party may see a captain training fresh recruits.  
- The building to the west of the barracks is only slightly smaller, and more barn-like. The party may see supply wagons being carted in.  
- There is a large canvas tent near the barracks. Two guards stand watch out front. A gust of wind whips up one of the side-flaps, revealing large cages inside. This is the stronghold's prison.  
- Spiral stairs at the intersecting corners of each of the walls provide access to the upper levels. The pathways along the top of the wall are 5 feet wide, and provide three-quarters cover for characters firing down on targets.  
- There are two large levers inside the gate. One controls the portcullis, and the other the drawbridge. The drawbridge lever can be pulled quickly, causing it to swing open. The portcullis lever drops the portcullis across the entrance. Large rope pulleys on either side are used to reset the levers.  
- There are at least a dozen bandits inside the courtyard. Some are training by the barracks, some are helping move supplies around the fort, and others are simply enjoying downtime by reading and whittling behind the safety of the walls.  

### The Art of Infiltration

If the party snuck in or managed to bluff their way inside, it's pretty easy to keep a low profile and explore the courtyard. Most bandits will assume they're supposed to be here, unless the party does something to draw the suspicion of the captains. If the party strikes up conversations with members of the camp, or attempts to scout around with a successful DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, they should be able to find out one of the following pieces of information:

- The Bandit Coalition used to be a far less organized and effective force until General Seridan took over. She has really changed things for the better, and the stronghold is now well-stocked and prepared, even if Alderheart sends an army to drive them out.  
- Not all who live here can fight. Some work as messengers, cooks, healers, and other odd jobs that keep the camp running. The General has never forced anyone to fight. She inspires them to take up arms by example, and support the cause to the best of their abilities.  
- General Seridan has taken excellent care of the people here since the fires burned their homes and ruined their lives. There is an infirmary in the inner keep to treat those burned while fleeing their villages or wounded in raids. Some of the refugees are children, but Benna has provided for them all the same.  
- The General lost her family to the fires. If the Birdfolk Council had listened to Benna's mother, a powerful seer, they might have lived.  
- Alderheart needs to change its ways of dealing with humblefolk in the Wood, and General Seridan is the only one with the vision to make it happen. Members of the Coalition should take heart, and know that they're helping to shape the Wood for the better.  
- Alderheart should be prepared for a reckoning. The Birdfolk Council should fear the power of the Coalition.  

If some of the party have been escorted in as prisoners, the guards at the gate will wave over reinforcements to help characters posing as bandits transport the hostages to the prison in the courtyard. They'll be able to escape later (see The Prison).

### Entering By Force

Should the party fight their way in, or decide to start a fight once inside, they can expect to be set upon in waves as messengers rush to alert Benna, while the rest of the camp prepares for the worst. At first the party will fight four [mapach bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md) led by a [vulpin captain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vulpin-captain-hwcs.md), then two [jerbeen thieves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-thief-hwcs.md) and another [vulpin captain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vulpin-captain-hwcs.md). If any archers have been left on the walls, they will fire from three-quarters cover throughout the fights, only retreating once the last of the bandit forces have been dispatched. During the fight, the rest of the bandits here will have made their way up the road to the inner fortress.

***If the party defeats the courtyard's forces,*** they will have an opportunity for a short rest before continuing, as the Coalition holes up in the inner fortress, fearing reinforcements are coming. If the party lingers for too long after their rest, start sending bandit patrols down to assess the situation and report back to Benna. Otherwise, skip to The Inner Keep.

***If the party is defeated,*** decide whether they are taken to the prison for a jailbreak sequence (see The Prison), or whether they are delivered to the meeting hall of the inner keep for a final showdown with Benna (see The Bandit Leader).

## The Barracks

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Rows of triple decker bunk beds can be seen next to a rest area, where a table lies strewn with playing cards and game pieces. Some of the bunks are occupied by people sleeping or reading, and a few of the bunks have sheathed weapons and leather armor hanging from hooks built into their frames. Stairs lead from this main area up to the top level. There looks to be ample space here for all who live in the camp.
^096

The barracks serve as the main living quarters. Many who live here train to become raiders in order to advance the aims of the Coalition across the Wood. At any given time there will be empty beds, as some bandits are out patrolling, working, or taking up other posts throughout the camp.

The game table in the corner is usually empty during the day, but at night it may be filled with off-shift bandits who gather for games over flagons of ale after a hard day.

Upstairs, the party will find more rows of bunk beds, some occupied, as well as a door marked "Captains' Quarters." Entry to this area is off limits to most bandits, but individuals bearing a captain's sword may enter untroubled. Otherwise, anyone in the nearby bunks will politely inform the party that the area is restricted. They may even introduce themselves, as new recruits are common, and declare how good it is to see new members for the cause. This can be an opportunity to continue to drip-feed the party information from The Art of Infiltration, so long as the party doesn't do anything to arouse the suspicion of NPCs.

Inside the captains' quarters there are four single beds, each with a personal storage trunk in front. There's nothing here for General Seridan, however. She sleeps in the inner keep. All the beds are empty, and the trunks each contain different personal effects, such as small trinkets and letters from friends and family. Some of the letters reveal that the captains have friends and family in the Coalition, while others are scattered among the Wood as refugees. There are also a handful of coins between the trunks (`2d4` gold pieces worth), as well as `1d4` trinkets and `1d4` tools or instruments (your choice). Some of these objects bear scorch marks.

If the scene could use a little tension, have a [vulpin captain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vulpin-captain-hwcs.md) walk in on the party, and require them to roleplay their way out of the situation or risk having their cover blown.

If the party is captured, decide whether they're taken to the prison for a jailbreak sequence (see The Prison), or whether to have them delivered to the meeting hall of the inner keep for a final showdown with Benna (see The Bandit Leader).

## The Storeroom

Nothing of much value can be found in this storeroom, which keeps enough food (fruits, vegetables, cured meats, and grains) to sustain the fort for an extended period of time. There are also torches, lanterns, rope, and other general supplies. There isn't much in the way of a guard here, but a hedge with bright eyes and incredibly thick spectacles does serve as the storeroom's keeper. He'll mention the characters are free to take something if they're hungry, but to let him know so he can record it in his ledger. If questioned, his attitude will be similar to that of the other bandits in the camp (see The Art of Infiltration), and he will call the guards if the party arouses his suspicion.

## The Prison

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The interior of this large canvas tent contains a small open area with a large locked chest, and a chair where the gaoler sits, a ring of keys hanging loosely from her belt. The rest of the area is filled with four rusty-looking iron cages. The cages are all currently empty.
^099

If any of the party members are captured, or brought into the fort posing as hostages, they'll wind up here in one or more of the cages. This tent is watched by two [jerbeen thieves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-thief-hwcs.md), and attacking them directly is all but certain to raise an alarm within the camp. Any weapons or treasure (coins, gems, and art objects) characters carry will be moved into the gaoler's chest until they can be properly sorted. All other clothing and equipment worn by the prisoner will be left alone. The gaoler is a bit lax and doesn't bother to remove anyone's armor, or do a detailed search. This might be a boon for any characters who have hidden objects on their person.

Gaolers trade shifts once a day at noon, passing the belt from which the keyring hangs to the next gaoler as they arrive. The gaoler is more of an attendant than the guards outside, and can be easily subdued by a character (use the [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block). The gaoler's job is to stay at their post and call the guards if anything happens. They are a tad complacent however, as no prisoners have tried to escape.

The prison tent is held up by poles throughout its interior, and four pitons that keep it all in place. The flaps of the tent can be lifted easily. Clearly, the tent's function is mainly to keep the cages from rusting further. The makeshift prison's interior is 30-foot-wide and 35-foot-long, and light filters through the canvas during the daytime making it easy to distinguish day and night. The cages are 10-foot-cubes, and have 10-foot-wide paths between them. They nearly fill the small space, leaving barely 5 feet between the gaoler and the bars. This is easily enough distance for a character to attempt to grab the keyring on the gaoler's belt, so long as the party can create a distraction to keep the gaoler occupied while they work. Grabbing the keyring from the gaoler's belt requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check, but depending on the nature of the distraction (such as if the gaoler is put to sleep) advantage may be granted on this roll.

The cage bars are heavily rusted, and some are weak enough to bend with a successful DC 12 Strength check, allowing a character to slip out. The gaoler is watchful, however, so they would need to be distracted for this plan to succeed.

There are any number of ways a party could plot an escape. If the players are having a difficult time, provide them some hints at the solutions above, or present them with an opportunity by having a gaoler fall asleep during their shift. If the party escapes, they should be able to evade the guards (who are mostly focused on threats outside the walls) with a successful DC 13 Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check. The party has advantage on all stealth checks rolled at night.

If the party is caught escaping from the gaol, use this opportunity to have them brought before Benna Seridan in the inner keep to initiate the final showdown with the bandit general (see The Bandit Leader).

## The Inner Keep

Refer to Fig. 2.4 for a map of the Inner Keep.

> 
> The map provides suggested starting positions for the bandits in each area. An asterisk on a creature indicates that it has some changes to its stat block. Refer to the numbered areas in which they appear for these details.
^using-the-inner-keep-map

If the party kept a low profile and made it to this location while exploring the camp, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The rough road to the north of the courtyard climbs up the steep crags until it curves, revealing a forty-foot-tall barricade of logs lashed together, and a large set of double doors. A pair of tough-looking mapachs in chain armor eye you warily as you approach. One saunters up, raising a hand to halt you. "That's far enough, friend," he says in a gravelly voice. "State your business."
^09c

If the camp was alerted to the intruders, the guards will be openly hostile and it will be a fight.

The outer guards use stat blocks identical to the [mapach bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md) who guard the fortress gate (see The Bandit Stronghold). There is a much smaller courtyard here, and unlike the one the party came through, no one is milling around. People don't come here without reason. There are two square wooden buildings, one to the east and another to the west:

- The larger one to the east is the infirmary.  
- The building to the west is smaller and has a strong lock on the door. This leads to the armory.  

A narrow pathway between the two leads to a sturdy wooden door that grants access to the inner keep carved into the mountainside.

### 1. The Infirmary

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Several cots occupy the inside of this space. A shelf at one corner of the room is filled with salves and tinctures, as well as a few books and some herb samples preserved in glass jars and fluids. A wooden table nearby, stained with long-dried blood, has an opened healer's kit upon it. Three bandits, bandaged along various parts of their bodies, are resting on the cots.
^09e

This building serves as a burn ward and infirmary for the bandits. A [jerbeen thief](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-thief-hwcs.md) and two hedges rest here (for the hedges, use the stat block for a [mapach bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md)). The three bandits are fast asleep thanks to some sleeping herbs, and will not wake unless a character attacks or forces them awake. If awakened, they will assume the characters are friendly, but they will immediately shout for help if characters give any indication of being otherwise.

If the bandits are left asleep, a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([Medicine](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check on their bodies will reveal they were treated by a healer of some skill. The [healer's kit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/healers-kit.md) is missing six uses, but is otherwise perfectly serviceable. The shelf contains two burn salves, which can be applied to heal `4d4` hit points each, but will only work if the damage was caused by fire. The two books are valuable advanced medical texts worth 5 gp each. Characters who have both of these books on hand, and at least a minute to skim through them, have advantage on all Intelligence and Wisdom checks related to medical matters. The herbs are useless to characters without proper training, but anyone with proficiency in a [herbalism kit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/herbalism-kit.md) could use them to craft a single [potion of superior healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-superior-healing.md).

### 2. The Armory

The lock to this building is made of heavy iron and is incredibly sturdy, requiring a successful DC 17 Dexterity ([Thieves' Tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)) check to open. The lock can be broken by force, but it has an AC of 18, 20 hit points, and resistance to all non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. The noise of breaking it may draw bandits from the inner keep.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This small building contains a rack of weapons, an armor rack, and bags of assorted treasure in a pile.
^0a0

The armory doubles as storage for valuables. If the party managed to enter, they will find:

- Three coffers overspilling with coins, there's at least 800 gp worth, in various denominations. This is too much for the party to carry out at once without some clever thinking.  
- A small box filled with an assortment of precious jewelry. Among them is a necklace of polished shells and pearls worth 200 gp, and a high quality ring inlaid with gold and polished wood worth 400 gp. The rest of the baubles will fetch 320 gp together on the market.  
- Two paintings of the Wood, one of the Mokk Fields at sunset, and the other of the sunrise behind Alderheart. They are signed by an unknown artist. These were made by an artist of uncommon skill, and can easily fetch 300 gp each on the market.  
- Four [light crossbows](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/light-crossbow.md), each next to a full [quiver](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/quiver.md) of [bolts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/crossbow-bolts-20.md), sit on a weapon rack, alongside a finely kept [longsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/longsword.md) and a [halberd](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/halberd.md). This halberd is obviously one used by the Perch Guard, and even has divots on the top part of the haft where a banner could be affixed.  
- A suit of [scale mail](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/scale-mail.md) on the armor rack.  

### 3. The Meeting Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Three long tables are crammed into this meeting area. Two of them along the sides, a jumble of chairs packed together at each one. Remains of a meal still linger in front of each seat. On the northern wall there is a third table with a single high-backed chair. Candles and a single iron chandelier bathe the area in a dim light. Two jerbeen sentries stand watch over a door in the hall's northeast corner.
^0a2

The meeting hall was a part of the fortress long before the bandits moved in. The stonework has aged, but is still of high quality. This is where the denizens of the stronghold share their meals, and the table near the northern wall is often stood upon, and used to share stories of suffering as well as news of successful raids.

Inside the meeting hall, a pair of veteran jerbeen guards stand outside the entrance to their leader's personal chambers. These are Benna's elite skirmishers. Each uses the stat block for a [jerbeen thief](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/jerbeen-thief-hwcs.md), but with the following changes:

- They are wearing pilfered [scale mail](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/scale-mail.md) (AC 16).  
- They wield a [rapier](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rapier.md) (which deals `1d8 + 2` piercing damage on a hit) as well as a [dagger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/dagger.md) (which deals `1d4 + 2` piercing damage on a hit), and they can make one attack with each as part of their [Attack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action.  

If a fight ensues, the noise will draw Benna from her chambers (see Cut Off the Head). Have her act immediately at the top of the round.

## The Bandit Leader

Whatever the party's plan is, all roads eventually lead to [Benna Seridan](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/benna-seridan-hwcs.md), leader of the Bandit Coalition. If the party was brought to the meeting hall after being captured, they will encounter Benna, standing atop the northmost table. The two elite skirmishers guarding the area will keep watch on either side of the party.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A solid cervan woman with a face partially obscured by a red bandana fixes you with a stony glare. "So, this is what Alderheart sends: a group of greenhorns? Pathetic. If you knew what we're fighting for you wouldn't be so quick to condemn us."
^0a4

Their engagement can be roleplayed, or have Benna simply draw on the party, explaining that she'll end the threat they pose to her operations here once and for all (see Cut Off the Head). Benna isn't unreasonable, and will listen to the party if they engage with her. She is conflicted, and unpredictable as a result. The trauma that led her to join the Coalition, as well as the actions she took to become its general, have hardened her heart, and she is bent not only on change, but revenge. She loathes the Birdfolk Council, whom she still holds responsible for the deaths of her family and the destruction of her home. She also blames them for the suffering of all those who have lost their homes to the flames, as the Council has chosen to hide behind the bastion of Alderheart instead of reaching out to help folk in need. However, Benna has begun to find solace in the act of caring for others. Building a community here, using her combat experience to teach others to defend themselves, and inspiring the once hopeless people of the Wood has ignited a passion within her, and she desperately wants to do right by her people. She has begun to wonder if there might be a better way to lead, one which wouldn't place so many of her loved ones in harm's way.

Should a character offer a particularly impassioned and heartfelt plea, decide how Benna behaves based on their roleplaying. If a player has to roll, their character must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. A successful negotiation will only be enough for Benna to agree to treat with the Birdfolk Council, her hated enemies, so that the lives she has fought to save are not lost needlessly in the struggle. If this is accomplished, the party will be allowed to leave the camp to deliver Benna's terms to the Council, but bandit activity will not stop in the interim. Failure to sway her here will lead to combat.

### Cut Off the Head

If the characters storm the inner keep, or if Benna has decided to attack the party, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Benna removes her bandana, revealing the concealed portion of her face. She is horribly burned, her left ear is gone, and her eye can barely be seen under the warped flesh. "The fires have already burned away everything I love. I will make sure they burn away the corruption that festers within Alderheart."
^0a6

Benna is a spirited and skilled foe, and will press the attack even to her own detriment. If at any point the fight seems too easy, add a patrol of two [mapach bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mapach-bandit-hwcs.md) returning to report. Benna will not flee, nor will she give up. The party will need to render Benna unconscious if they wish to take her captive and bring her to Alderheart to face the Council's judgement. Capturing Benna will allow the party to walk out of the stronghold without a fight, as the bandits will not risk injury to their leader.

If Benna is killed, the members of the Coalition will scatter, taking what they can as they move to safehouses stationed all over the Wood.

> [!note] Treasure
> 
> As with the bandit camp, there is a wealth of treasure to be found in the armory of the complex (see 2. The Armory), as well as Benna's personal quarters. Most of this loot is stolen, and belongs to various merchants and residents of Humblewood. The council will allow the party to keep half of the treasure as a reward for their services, just as before.
> 
> The party will also be free to keep the [blade of the wood](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/blade-of-the-wood-hwcs.md) recovered from Benna.
> 
> The party finds the following in Benna's quarters:
> 
> - A scorched music box. It is made of varnished alderwood and inlaid with gold. When opened, a cervan dancer spins on a spring to a familiar humblefolk folk tune. Despite its condition, this rare item is worth 300 gp.  
> - A rough map of the Crest and the peninsula to the northeast.

## What the Future May Hold

This is a major part of the story completed, as now the bandits will return to being a far less threatening force in the Wood. Ultimately there are two ways this part of the story can end: with Benna slain, or with the Council and Benna negotiating for a better outcome for the Wood's displaced humblefolk.

***If Benna was captured,*** and delivered to the Birdfolk Council as promised, the party should be made aware that the penalty for her crimes is death. Even so, there may still be hope for the characters to convince the Birdfolk Council to improve the lives of humblefolk.

Either the party or Benna can plead for Benna's life and the desperate cause of humblefolk in the Wood, leading to a new directive for the Coalition; go to **If Benna was reasoned with**.

If Benna can't be reasoned with and is executed, the Coalition won't be interested in peace talks; go to **If Benna was killed**.

***If the Benna was reasoned with***, the Birdfolk Council will be dismayed and angry at first. The party will need to spend some time convincing the Council of the good Benna has done, and the benefits of treating with her and her organization. It will take some heated discussion, but the Council members will consent to meeting with her provisionally. After hearing Benna's story, the Council's disposition will soften. They will agree on the need to provide aid to the humblefolk who have lost their homes to the fire.

The Bandit Coalition will keep control of the fortress. Either Benna will retain command, or she'll support a new leader being appointed for the Coalition—this could be the characters (if they so choose), or someone selected from among Benna's captains. The Council will work with whoever leads the Coalition, provided the party (if they don't take over themselves) can vouch for the leader's good intentions and agrees to keep them in line. Spurred by a new purpose, the criminal elements of the Coalition will be put to an end, and the organization will turn into a relief network for those displaced by the fires.

With the Coalition's supply networks and Alderheart's resources working together, response times for relief efforts will be greatly improved. While some members of the Coalition will abandon the cause for their own gains, many will be willing to help it transition into an organization dedicated to helping fight the spreading fires and provide relief and shelter to those in need. The Birdfolk Council will release a decree: they will become the Humblewood Council, and new representatives from major humblefolk villages in the regions and within Alderheart itself will be added to their numbers, effectively giving humblefolk across the Wood a voice in governance for the first time. This significant change will take the span of the adventure to resolve, but by the end, the Humblewood Council will lead the way to a new era of unity in Humblewood. Now dedicated to peace, Benna will show her gratitude by presenting the party with the [blade of the wood](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/blade-of-the-wood-hwcs.md) she once wielded.

***If Benna was killed,*** between losing their camp near Alderheart and their mountain stronghold, the Coalition will be dealt a heavy blow and the bandit menace will no longer pose the same threat to the region. Many will lose hope and desert without Benna, but others will see her as a martyr and rally under a surviving captain. Members will work from safehouses in the forests, doing their best to keep the Coalition command structure intact, and continue to cause problems for the Wood after the events of this adventure. Perhaps peace can be achieved someday, when the wounds of losing their beloved leader aren't so fresh. But, without Benna, the Coalition won't trust or treat with outsiders.

Once the bandit general has been defeated, the Council will send an armed force to secure the stronghold. Should the players wish, this could become their base of operations. The Council will happily grant this boon to the party as they have proven themselves to be valuable allies and defenders of the realm. A small contingent of guards and hirelings from the Birdfolk Council will oversee the upkeep and protection of the fortress while the party is away. The Council does, however, expect the heroes to come to the aid of the realm whenever summoned to do so.

### Defenders of Alderheart

Regardless of how the party dealt with this, the Alderites will remember them as the ones who saved their city by ending the threat of the Bandit Coalition. With the bandit threat halted by the party's efforts, the Council will gladly send for a contingent of Perch Guard to Meadowfen with much needed supplies. Henceforth, rumors of the party's deeds will slowly begin to spread across the realm, and soon the people of the Wood will recognize the party by their new title: the Defenders of Alderheart.
