# Skills with Different Abilities
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 175* 

Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in [Athletics](rules/skills.md#Athletics), for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in [Athletics](rules/skills.md#Athletics) and ask for a Constitution ([Athletics](rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. So if you're proficient in [Athletics](rules/skills.md#Athletics), you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength ([Athletics](rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength ([Intimidation](rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check, even though [Intimidation](rules/skills.md#Intimidation) is normally associated with Charisma.
