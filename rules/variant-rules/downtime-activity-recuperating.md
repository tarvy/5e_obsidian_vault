# Downtime Activity: Recuperating
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 187* 

You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.

After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:

- End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.  
- For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.
