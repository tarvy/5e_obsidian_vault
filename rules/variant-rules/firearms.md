# Firearms
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 267* 

If you want to model the swashbuckling style of The Three Musketeers and similar tales, you can introduce gunpowder weapon to your campaign that are associated with the Renaissance. Similarly, in a campaign where a spaceship has crashed or elements of modern-day Earth are present, futuristic or modern firearms might appear. The Firearms table provides examples of firearms from all three of those periods. The modern and futuristic items are priceless.

## Proficiency

It's up to you to decide whether a character has proficiency with a firearm. Characters in most D&D worlds wouldn't have such proficiency. During their downtime, characters can use the [Downtime Activity: Training](rules/variant-rules/downtime-activity-training.md) rules in the "Player's Handbook" to acquire proficiency, assuming that they have enough ammunition to keep the weapons working while mastering their use.

## Properties

Firearms use special ammunition, and some of them have the burst fire or reload property.

### Ammunition

The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Renaissance and modern firearms use bullets. Futuristic firearms are powered by a special type of ammunition called energy cells. An energy cell contains enough power for all the shots its firearm can make.

### Burst Fire

A weapon that has the burst fire property can make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a 10-foot-cube area within normal range with shots. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the weapon's normal damage. This action uses ten pieces of ammunition.

### Reload

A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).
