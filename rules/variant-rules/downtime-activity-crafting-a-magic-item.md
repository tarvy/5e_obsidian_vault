# Downtime Activity: Crafting a Magic Item
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 128* 

Magic items are the DM's purview, so you decide how they fall into the party's possession. As an option, you can allow player characters to craft magic items.

The creation of a magic item is a lengthy, expensive task. To start, a character must have a formula that describes the construction of the item. The character must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must be able to cast any spells that the item can produce. Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum determined by the item's rarity, as shown in the Crafting Magic Items table. For example, a 3rd-level character could create a [wand of magic missiles](compendium/items/wand-of-magic-missiles.md) (an uncommon item), as long as the character has spell slots and can cast [magic missile](compendium/spells/magic-missile.md). That same character could make a [+1 weapon](compendium/items/1-weapon.md) (another uncommon item), no particular spell required.

You can decide that certain items also require special materials or locations to be created. For example, a character might need [alchemist's supplies](compendium/items/alchemists-supplies.md) to brew a particular potion, or the formula for a [flame tongue](compendium/items/flame-tongue.md) might require that the weapon be forged with lava.

**Crafting Magic Items**

| Item Rarity | Creation Cost | Minimum Level |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Common | 100 gp | 3rd |
| Uncommon | 500 gp | 3rd |
| Rare | 5,000 gp | 6th |
| Very rare | 50,000 gp | 11th |
| Legendary | 500,000 gp | 17th |

An item has a creation cost specified in the Crafting Magic Items table. A character engaged in the crafting of a magic item makes progress in 25 gp increments, spending that amount for each day of work until the total cost is paid. The character is assumed to work for 8 hours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon magic item takes 20 days and 500 gp. You are free to adjust the costs to better suit your campaign.

If a spell will be produced by the item being created, the creator must expend one spell slot of the spell's level for each day of the creation process. The spell's material components must also be at hand throughout the process. If the spell normally consumes those components, they are consumed by the creation process. If the item will be able to produce the spell only once, as with a [spell scroll](compendium/items/spell-scroll.md), the components are consumed only once by the process. Otherwise, the components are consumed once each day of the item's creation.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts to create a magic item if each of them meets the level prerequisite. Each character can contribute spells, spell slots and components, as long as everyone participates during the entire crafting process. Each character can contribute 25 gp worth of effort for each day spent helping to craft the item.

Normally, a character who undertakes this activity creates a magic item described in chapter 7, "Treasure." At your discretion, you can allow players to design their own magic items, using the guidelines in chapter 9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop."

While crafting a magic item, a character can maintain modest lifestyle without having to pay the 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5, ""Equipment"," of the "Player's Handbook").

> [!note] Magic Item Formulas
> 
> A magic item formula explains how to make a particular magic item. Such a formula can be an excellent reward if you allow player characters to craft magic items.
> 
> You can award a formula in place of a magic item. Usually written in a book or on a scroll, a formula is one step rarer than the item it allows a character to create. For example, the formula for a common magic item is uncommon. No formulas exist for legendary items.
> 
> If the creation of magic items is commonplace in your campaign, a formula can have a rarity that matches the rarity of the item it allows a character to create. Formulas for common and uncommon items might even be for sale, each with a cost double that of its magic item.
