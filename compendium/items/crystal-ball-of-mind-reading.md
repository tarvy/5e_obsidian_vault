# Crystal Ball of Mind Reading
*Wondrous Item, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This [crystal ball](compendium/items/crystal-ball.md) is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the [scrying](compendium/spells/scrying.md) spell (save DC 17) with it.

You can use an action to cast the [detect thoughts](compendium/spells/detect-thoughts.md) spell (save DC 17) while you are [scrying](compendium/spells/scrying.md) with the [crystal ball](compendium/items/crystal-ball.md), targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this [detect thoughts](compendium/spells/detect-thoughts.md) to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if [scrying](compendium/spells/scrying.md) ends.
