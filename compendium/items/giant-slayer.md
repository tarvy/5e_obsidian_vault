# Giant Slayer
*Generic Variant, major, rare*  


You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you hit a giant with it, the giant takes an extra `2d6` damage of the weapon's type and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone). For the purpose of this weapon, "giant" refers to any creature with the giant type, including ettins and trolls.
