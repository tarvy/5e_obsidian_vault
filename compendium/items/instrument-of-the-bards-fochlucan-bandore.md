# Instrument of the Bards, Fochlucan Bandore
*Instrument, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)*  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `2d4` psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: [fly](compendium/spells/fly.md), [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md), [levitate](compendium/spells/levitate.md), and [protection from evil and good](compendium/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md).

In addition, the Fochlucan bandore can be used to cast [entangle](compendium/spells/entangle.md), [faerie fire](compendium/spells/faerie-fire.md), [shillelagh](compendium/spells/shillelagh.md), and [speak with animals](compendium/spells/speak-with-animals.md).
