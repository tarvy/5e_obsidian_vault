# Frost Brand
*Generic Variant, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  


When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra `1d6` cold damage. In addition, while you hold the sword, you have resistance to fire damage.

In freezing temperatures, the blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
