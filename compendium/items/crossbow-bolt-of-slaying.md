# Crossbow Bolt of Slaying
*Ammunition, minor, very rare*  

- **Weight**: 0.075 lbs.

a crossbow bolt of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both *crossbow bolts of dragon slaying* and *crossbow bolts of blue dragon slaying*. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with a crossbow bolt of slaying takes damage from the crossbow bolt, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra `6d10` piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once a crossbow bolt of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical crossbow bolt.
