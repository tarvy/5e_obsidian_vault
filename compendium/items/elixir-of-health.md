# Elixir of Health
*Potion, minor, rare*  


When you drink this potion, it cures any disease afflicting you, and it removes the [blinded](rules/conditions.md#blinded), [deafened](rules/conditions.md#deafened), [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#paralyzed), and [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) conditions. The clear red liquid has tiny bubbles of light in it.
