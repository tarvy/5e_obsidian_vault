# Power Word Heal
*9th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed), [frightened](rules/conditions.md#frightened), [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#paralyzed), or [stunned](rules/conditions.md#stunned), the condition ends. If the creature is [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone), it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

**Classes**: [Bard](compendium/classes/bard.md)
