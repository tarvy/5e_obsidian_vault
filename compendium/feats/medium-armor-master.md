# Medium Armor Master
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 168*  

**Prerequisite**: Proficiency with medium armor

You have practiced moving in medium armor to gain the following benefits:

- Wearing medium armor doesn't impose disadvantage on your Dexterity ([Stealth](rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks.  
- When you wear medium armor, you can add 3, rather than 2, to your AC if you have a Dexterity of 16 or higher.
