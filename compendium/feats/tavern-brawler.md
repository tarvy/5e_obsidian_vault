# Tavern Brawler
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 170*  

Accustomed to rough-and-tumble fighting using whatever weapons happen to be at hand, you gain the following benefits:

- You are proficient with improvised weapons.  
- Your unarmed strike uses a `d4` for damage.  
- When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or an improvised weapon on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the target.
