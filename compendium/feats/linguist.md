# Linguist
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 167*  

You have studied languages and codes, gaining the following benefits:

- You learn three languages of your choice.  
- You can ably create written ciphers. Others can't decipher a code you create unless you teach them, they succeed on an Intelligence check (DC equal to your Intelligence score + your proficiency bonus), or they use magic to decipher it.
