# Mobile
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 168*  

You are exceptionally speedy and agile. You gain the following benefits:

- Your speed increases by 10 feet.  
- When you use the [Dash](rules/actions.md#Dash) action, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement on that turn.  
- When you make a melee attack against a creature, you don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn, whether you hit or not.
