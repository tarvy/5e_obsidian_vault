# Healer
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 167*  

You are an able physician, allowing you to mend wounds quickly and get your allies back in the fight. You gain the following benefits:

- When you use a [healer's kit](compendium/items/healers-kit.md) to stabilize a dying creature, that creature also regains 1 hit point.  
- As an action, you can spend one use of a [healer's kit](compendium/items/healers-kit.md) to tend to a creature and restore `1d6 + 4` hit points to it, plus additional hit points equal to the creature's maximum number of Hit Dice. The creature can't regain hit points from this feat again until it finishes a short or long rest.
