# Charger
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 165*  

When you use your action to [Dash](rules/actions.md#Dash), you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to [shove](rules/actions.md#shove) a creature.

If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taking this bonus action, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attack's damage roll (if you chose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to shove and you succeed).
